History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with PMH of HTN, poorly controlled diabetes 
who was admitted to CCU for management of LAD STEMI. Patient 
reports episodes of severe chest pain associated with shortness 
of breath, palpitations, diaphoresis and nausea about three 
weeks ago. He went to ___ at that time and was 
treated with Levaquin for pneumonia.  He reports not being able 
to sleep for 3 nights due to chest pain and shortness of breath. 
 His symptoms then improved however he was still not back to his 
baseline.  He overall felt more tired and fatigue.  Then last 
night he had recurrence of his chest chest tightness of ___ 
associated with tachycardia and shortness of breath. He then 
presented to ___ this morning and was found to have 
wide-complex tachycardia and HR in the 190s. He was then given 2 
doses of adenosine and 1 dose of amiodarone with no relief of 
symptoms. He was then cardioverted successfuly with 200J then 
360J. Repeat EKG showed sinus rhythm with ST Elevations of 2mm 
in V2, 0.5mm in V1 and 1mm in V3. He was then asymptomatic with 
no chest pain or shortness of breath. He was given aspirin and 
started on Heparin gtt. He was then transferred to ___ for 
further evaluation and management.

He was taken directly to cath lab for concern of STEMI.  In the 
cath lab, he was found to have complete occlusion of mid LAD 
which was stented with DES through right radial access. He was 
started on Tirofiban and was 600mg plavix loaded. Subsequently 
admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.

Currently patient reports shortness of breath and chest pain has 
resolved.  He reports episodes of shortness of breath, orthopnea 
and PND in the past three weeks.

aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally 
normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___, 
You were transferred to ___ for treatment of your chest 
pain and arrythmia. You EKG was concerning and upon arrival you 
were taken to the cardiac cathterization lab where a blockage 
was found in the left anterior descending artery. A ___ was 
placed to open the blockage successfully. Following the cardiac 
cathterization an ultrasound of the heart called an 
echocardiogram was done which revealed a clot in the left 
ventricle which puts you at risk for stroke. You were started on 
anticoagulation called coumadin which we are monitoring its 
effectiveness by drawing a lab called an INR. Dr. ___ will call 
you to dose your coumadin appropriately based on these labs. You 
will receive lab slips for the outpatient lab work. 

Because you had a lethal arrythmia called ventricular 
tachycardia you needed an ICD, defibrillator which was placed in 
the chest and will activate if you go into another lethal 
arrythmia while at home. You have a follow up in the device 
clinic to assess the site and the settings.

You now have a history of heart failure and need to weigh 
yourself every day. If your weight goes up more than 3 pounds in 
1 day or more than 5 pounds in 2 days please call Dr. ___. Your 
weight on day of discharge is 295 pounds. 

You have been started on insulin for your blood sugars which was 
not well controlled on pills alone and have been given injection 
teaching and wil have a follow up with ___ for care in the 
next week. 

You have been given an updated list of the medications you are 
taking on discharge. 

Activity restrictions per nursing. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you this hospitalization. If 
you have any queations related to your stay please feel free to 
contact the heartline. 
 
Followup Instructions:
