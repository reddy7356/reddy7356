INDICATION:  History of lower abdominal pain.  Rule out 
appendicitis. 
  
COMPARISONS:  None. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  ___ MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and 
pelvis after 
the administration of IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted 
images in coronal 
and sagittal axis were generated and reviewed. 
  
FINDINGS:  The bases of the lungs are clear.   
  
ABDOMEN: The liver is normal without evidence of focal lesions 
or intrahepatic 
biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder is normal without 
evidence of wall 
thickening or stones.  Adrenal glands bilaterally are normal.  
Spleen is 
homogeneous and normal in size.  Pancreas is normal without 
evidence of focal 
lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation.  Kidneys bilaterally 
are normal 
without evidence of focal lesions or perinephric stranding.  
There is 
symmetric excretion of contrast.  There is no evidence of 
pelvicaliceal 
dilatation. The intra-abdominal vasculature is unremarkable. 
  
The stomach and duodenum are unremarkable. Small bowel is 
nondilated.  
Adjacent to a loop of distal ileum on series 2, image 48-55, 
there is 
localized fat stranding and a few locules of extraluminal gas. 
There is only 
mild thickening of the adjacent small bowel. A fluid filled 
structure is seen 
in this region, series 601b, image 28, measuring 2.2  x 1.3 cm 
which could 
represent either a small abscess or meckel's diverticulum. There 
may be a 
small neck connecting this fluid collection with the adjacent 
small bowel 
(601b;27).  
  
PELVIS:  The colon is collapsed, however, appears unremarkable.  
The appendix 
is normal.  There is a large mesenteric node (series 2, image 
47) measuring 
1.1 cm. Additional adjacent prominent reactive nodes are 
identified. There is 
free fluid within the pelvis.  The bladder is unremarkable.  The 
terminal 
ureters are normal.  No pelvic wall or inguinal lymphadenopathy 
is identified. 
  
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for 
malignancy are 
identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
  
1. Inflammatory changes centered around distal small bowel with 
mild bowel 
wall thickening, fat stranding, and small amount of free air. 
Given the 
presence of a tubular fluid filled structure in this region, 
Meckels 
diverticulitis is a potential consideration. Also in the ddx: 
inflammatory 
bowel disease (Crohn's) with small abscess/perforation vs 
infectious 
enteritis. 
  
2. Normal appendix. 

INDICATION:  History of right lower rib pain.  Rule out 
pneumothorax. 
  
COMPARISONS:  None. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest. 
  
FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.  The hilar and mediastinal 
contours are 
normal.  The lungs are clear without evidence of focal 
consolidations, 
pneumothoraces or pleural effusions. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. 
  
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. 

  
___'s Study pending XXXXXXX
