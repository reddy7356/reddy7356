seizure activity. Per daughter who is a ___ and lives with 
patient, the patient has been ill for ___ days with a cough. She 
has had significantly decreased PO intake since the onset of 
this illness. She has never had a fever. She was prescribed a 
Z-pac without being seen which she completed. This AM, she

IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because
of generalized background slowing predominantly in the delta 
frequency range, although very briefly reaching up to ___ Hz, 
with frequent periods of generalized suppression which are 
consistent with a moderate encephalopathy of non-specific 
etiology. The background does show reactivity, however. 
Excessive diffuse beta activity can be seen with recent 
benzodiazepine or barbiturate usage. Incidental note is made of 
persistent bradycardia. No electrographic seizures are recorded.

___: EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study because
of generalized background slowing predominantly in the delta 
frequency range, although very briefly reaching up to 6 Hz, with 
frequent periods of
generalized suppression which are consistent with a moderate 
encephalopathy of non-specific etiology; the background does 
show reactivity, however.
Occasionally seen triphasic waves seen in the latter portion of 
the study are non-specific findings but often seen with 
toxic/metabolic encephalopathies. Excessive diffuse beta 
activity can be seen with recent benzodiazepine or barbiturate 
usage. Incidental note is made of bradycardia although this is 
improved from before. No electrographic seizures are recorded. 
When compared to the prior recording, there is mild interval 
improvement.

___: EEG
PENDING

IMAGING
=======
___: CHEST X-RAY PORTABLE
IMPRESSION: 
Increasing right basilar airspace opacity may be due to 
atelectasis or
infection.
NG tube likely coiled in a large hiatal hernia.

___: CHEST X-RAY PORTABLE
IMPRESSION:  
No relevant change as compared to the previous image, the 
patient is slightly rotated. The monitoring and support devices 
are constant.  A subtle opacity at the right lung base has not 
substantially changed. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No overt 
pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.

___: MRI HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No evidence of acute infarction.
2. Numerous white matter foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal 
are nonspecific but likely represent sequelae of chronic small 
vessel ischemic disease.

from an outside hospital for altered mental status, seizure and 
hyponatremia, found to have pneumonia and multifactorial 
hyponatremia (hypovolemia, medication effect, and syndrome of 
inappropriate ADH).

#Hyponatremia - According to the patient's daughter, Ms. ___ 
has history of severe hyponatremia (to 107) in the past. Nausea, 
vomiting, altered mental status symptoms consistent with 
hyponatremia. Unclear at first if this was hypovolemic 
hyponatremia in setting of acute illness and decreased PO intake 
while continuing anti-hypertensives but seems to be sub-acute. 
Initial Na 120 at OSH. Given 100mL hypertonic saline in OSH as 
well as intensive care uniti. Initial Na in ED at ___ 125, but 
on ___ to medical intensive care unit 116. Patient received 
additional hypertonic saline with improvement of sodium. Renal 
was consulted to aid in determining cause of hyponatremia. 
Initially thought hyponatremia was likely secondary to 
hypovolemia. After receiving small fluid boluses, Na improved 
suggesting volume depletion. However, Na peaked at 128 even 
after intravenous normal saline infusion. Urine lytes obtained 
and appeared as though the hyponatremia was consistent with 
SIADH (high urine osmolality with elevated urine sodium 
concentration) at that point in hospitalization. Patient was 
fluid restricted with improvement of her sodium. Patient was 
subsequently transferred from the intensive care unit to the 
general medical floor. Fluid restriction was continued (1.2L 
daily) and the sodium stabilized in the 135-140 range. Etiology 
of the hyponatremia appears to be a mixture of hypovolemia in 
the setting of hydrochlorothiazide use as well as SIADH in the 
setting of pneumonia (please see below). At the time of 
discharge Ms. ___ sodium was 140.  She was continued on 1.2 
L FLUID RESTRICTION AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE TO REHABILITATION. 
She should never be on HCTZ again. 

# Healthcare Associated Pneumonia - patient ill for ___ days 
PTA, however without fever but had reported cough. UA 
unremarkable. Received Vanc/Zosyn in ED.  Pt was cultured and 
was monitored for fever/signs of infection. Given question of 
pneumonia on CXR as well as being in hospital for 48 hours, 
decision was made to continue with vancomycin and cefepime for 
treatment of HCAP in the setting of SIADH. She received an 8 day 
course of vancomycin and cefepime. At the time of discharge she 
was afebrile with no leukocytosis. 

#Dementia and Delirium - Patient with baseline dementia, however 
sudden witnessed change on the day of admission with 
unresponsive, speaking "nonsensical" and grabbing towards air 
with right hand could be consistent with seizure vs stroke. CT 
head without bleed or large acute infarct. EEG did not show 
significant findings.  The patient's mental status improved and 
she was following commands and therefore extubated on hospital 
day #3. She had ongoing delirium during her hospitalization and 
was started on olanzapine 5mg QHS with improvement. Also 
continued on her rivastigmine 4.6 mg/24h transdermal patch. 

#? Seizure - patient without hx of seizure, however witnessed 
event at OSH ED consistent with seizure. Likely caused by 
hyponatremia.  Pt was initially started on keppra, however this 
was discontinued on HD 3. Patient's hyponatremia was managed as 
stated above. With stablilization of serum sodium, patient did 
not have any seizure-like episodes during hospitalization at 
___. 

#Hypertension: Patient's blood pressure was labile after 
discontinuation of hydrochlorothiazide with blood pressures in 
the 200s. To better control her blood pressure, she was started 
on an antihypertesnive regimen of lisinopril 40 milligrams 
daily, amlodipine 5 milligrams daily, and Metoprolol Succinate 
50 milligrams daily. On this blood pressure regimen, her 
systolic blood pressures ranged between 130-150. 
Hydrochlorothiazide was held at the time fo discharge. She 
should NEVER be put back on hydrochlorothizide in the future, 
given her two episodes of hyponatremia.

this an allergy, given her history of hyponatremia on two 
occassions in the setting of HCTZ.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your 
hospitalization. You were admitted to ___ 
___ after suffering a seizure. This was due to your 
sodium being low (hyponatremia). The cause of the low sodium was 
initially thought to be secondary to your hydrochlorothiazide as 
well as poor oral intake. 

You also were noted to have a pneumonia during your 
hospitalization. You were treated with antibiotics which 
resolved the pneumonia. You did not have any further fevers or 
coughs after being treated for the pneumonia. 

Your sodium continued to fluctuate during your hospitalization. 
In order to stabilize the sodium further (likely due to Syndrome 
of Inappropriate ADH, SIADH), we limited the volume of fluid you 
were able to consume to 1200 milliliters (1.2L). This helped 
stabilize your sodium levels. You did not have any further 
episodes of seizures during this hospitalization.

You were also noted to have high blood pressure during your 
hospitalizaiton after your hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. 
In order to better control your blood pressure, you were started 
on a blood pressure regimen of lisinopril 40 milligrams daily, 
amlodipine 5 milligrams daily, and Toprol XL 50 milligrams 
daily. 

In the future please DO NOT take your hydrochlorothiazide 
medication. 

Please limit the volume of fluid you consume each day to 1200 
milliliters (1.2 Liters). 

We wish you a happy and healthy ___!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team
