Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:

CT HEAD With and Without Contrast ___- 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Early visualization of the right cavernous sinus suspicious 
for carotid 
cavernous fistula given the extensive skull base fractures.  
Cerebral 
angiography can confirm this finding if clinically indicated. 
2.  Patent anterior and posterior circulations.  No aneurysm 
greater than 2 mm 
in size. 
3.  Comminuted extensive skull base frontal bone fractures and 
small subdural 
hematoma and intraparenchymal hematoma and pneumocephalus as on 
the outside 
CT. 
4.  Bilateral maxillary and ethmoid fractures and sphenoid sinus 
fractures 
with blood and fluid within the sinuses. 

Cerebral Angiogram ___ -
IMPRESSION: ___ underwent diagnostic cerebral angiogram 
which 
demonstrates low flow right carotid cavernous fistula.  No 
aneurysm is 
visualized.  Drainage appears to be via the petrosal sinuses, 
without enlarged orbital vessels identified.  There is no supply 
via the external carotid 
artery. 

CT Head Without Contrast - ___
IMPRESSION:  Interval improved alignment of comminuted frontal 
fractures with 
decreased pneumocephalus, trace frontal subdural fluid, and 
overlying 
subgaleal air.  Frontal contusions, left greater than right, are 
again seen 
with increased adjacent edema. 

CT Head Without Contrast - ___
1.  Status post frontal bone fracture fixation with near 
resolution of 
pneumocephalus and stable small frontal subdural blood product 
and fluid.  No 
evidence for new mass effect or hydrocephalus.   
  
2.  Persistent bifrontal parenchymal contusions with adjacent 
edema.
