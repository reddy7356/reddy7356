Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o DM2, hyperlipidemia, a recent allergic reaction to  
sulfonylurea in ___, and right lower extremity infections 
 
requiring skin grafts about a month ago, was admitted from ___ 
clinic for UTI that was resistant to many antibiotics and ___.  

#UTI: Urine culture from ___ grew morganella ___, 
susceptibility results show resistance to ceftriaxone, cipro, 
gent, tobra, nitrofurontoin, tobra, bactrum. Patient was satrted 
on cefepime on ___ and this was continued till ___ when 
urine cultures from ___ came back showing resistance to 
cefapime and only sensitive to meropenem and amikacin. Patient 
was discharged with follow up at infusion clinic for ertapenem 
infusions for 7 days. Renal team was consulted and they did not 
want patient with a PICC because patient will likely need 
dialysis eventually. Patient was asymptomatic during admission 
and had no fever or chills and normal WBC.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt was admitted with Scr 2.6 
elevated from most recent baseline of 2.1. Renal was consulted 
while patient was here and they recommended giving IVF. After 
giving 2 L of IVF  his Scr went from 2.6 -->2.2. Given that 
patient's Scr improved with IVF it is likely pt was pre-renal 
volume down, despite the fact that pt and son felt he had been 
eating well. Patient will follow up with ___ clinic in the 
next ___ weeks. Concern is that his Scr has gotten worse over 
the past few months (again his Scr was 1.2 in ___ and now 2.2). 
This is likely progression of his CKD.    

#Normocytic Anemia: Per OMR notes he has been worked up for this 
in the past and has had guaiac neg stools and was dx with anemia 
of chronic disease (though it is unclear what his chronic 
disease is, perhaps DM?). It is also possible that bc of CKD he 
has low epo which is causing low Hb. Hb on day of discharge 8.5. 


#HTN: -continued labetalol twice a day.  

#s/p lower ext skin infections requiring skin grafts. Wound care 
was consulted and they recommended: daily dressing changes with 
Xeroform to right leg
graft sites which was done while in house.

TRANSIATIONAL ISSUES:
#UTI: ___ 7 days
#Acute on chronic kidney disease: pt will follow up in ___ 
clinic
#Anemia: it may be worthwhile continuing an anemia workup

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a very pleasant ___ y/o M with PMH of DMII and HTN 
who presented to the ED for evaluation of 3 right lower 
extremity chronic surgical incisions. He reports that 
approximately 5 months ago he developed a disseminated pruritic 
skin rash after exposure to Diamecron. The rash resolved after 
stopping this medication, but a pustule remained on his RLE. 
This was seen by Dr. ___ reportedly appeared to be 
healing. The patient returned to ___, where on ___ he 
was in a minor car accident that caused mild trauma to his right 
knee. He was able to walk without any discomfort from this 
accident. However, after several days he began to lose his 
apetite, feel somewhat fatigued, and developed some RLE 
discomfort in the area of the knee. By this time, the pustule 
had finally just resolved. He received 3 shots of procaine into 
the knee at a small island and returned to the main island for 
further care but went home after feeling significantly improved. 
However, over the next 4 days he developed RLE pain and had 
difficulty walking. At this point, significant swelling had 
developed in the leg and at the hospital it was incised in an 
effort to "drain pus underneath the skin". He received 
antibiotics, twice daily dressing changes, and around ___ was 
cleared to travel to the ___ for further care.
On arrival to the ED (now 26 days s/p incisions), vitals were 
98.0 106 158/83 18 100%. ED attending undressed wounds and 
reported presence of pus. Evaluated by plastic surgery in the ED 
who felt wounds were clean, though given ED concern decision 
made to admit for further care and potential general surgery 
debridement if needed. He received a dose of vanc and unasyn as 
well as 1 dose hydromorphone.
Currently, the patient is very comfortable and without any 
complaints. He denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, 
vision changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, 
shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, 
hematuria.
He reports very mild urinary discomfort recently, and a U/A in 
the ED revealed 30 protein but only 2 WBCs, 1 Epi, neg leuk and 
neg nitr. Of note, lactate 2.9 and Cr 2.1 from baseline around 
1.2.
