Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where he underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
with cholangiogram.  He tolerated the procedure well and 
returned to the PACU in stable condition. After full recovery 
from anesthesia he complained on nausea and ___ abdominal pain 
and was therefore hospitalized overnight.

Pain continued to be an issue and STAT amylase and lipase were 
___ and ___ respectively.  He was maintained with IV fluids

His amylase and lipase dropped dramatically over the next ___ 
hours and he was gradually able to tolerate liquids and then 
advanced to diabetic, low fat regular diet.  His pain was better 
controlled, and he was up and walking without difficulty.

Cholangiogram identified an anatomic abnormality with ductal 
drainage in the pancreas and ERCP was indicated. However, due to 
his pancreatic flare up while hospitalized, the ERCP will be 
performed on an out patient basis.

At the time of discharge on ___, the patient was doing well, 
afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a 
diabetic, low fat regular diet, ambulating, voiding without
