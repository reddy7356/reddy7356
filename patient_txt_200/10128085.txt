Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at ___. You came in 
with worsening shortness of breath and underwent cardiac 
catheterization. This showed that you have no blockages in your 
heart vessels. As you know, your heart is not pumping as well as 
it should and this may be due to very high heart rates that you 
have had in the last few months. We have controlled your heart 
rate here with metoprolol and digoxin. We have also taken off 
the extra fluid you have collected in your body from poor heart 
function by using a water pill called lasix. You should continue 
to take this medication when you go home. Please notify your PCP 
if you have worsening shortness of breath or fluid collection in 
your legs. Your weight was 114.8kg (211.43lbs) on discharge. To 
prevent blood clots, you should take coumadin. Please have your 
INR checked on ___. Please notify your doctor if you gain 
more than 3 lbs because this means you may have to have your 
medications readjusted.

We wish you all the best in your recovery.

Sincerely,

Your ___ team

DL PICC placement

___
1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
2. Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL.

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a very pleasant ___ who
noted solid food dysphagia7 months ago. His symptoms worsened,
and on ___, he had a barium swallow which showed both
polypoid and mural mass within the distal esophagus,
approximately 25 mm proximal to the GE junction.

He underwent EGD ___ which showed a distal esophageal
circumferential ulceration and a fungating mucosal mass starting
at 34 cm and extending to 40 cm, just above the GE junction.
Biopsy showed moderately differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma.
HER-2/neu was negative. CEA was elevated (22.5) and CA-125 was
within normal limits.

CT torso ___ showed irregular asymmetric distal esophageal
wall thickening consistent with known distal esophageal mass 
with
epigastric and celiac axis lymph nodes which were nonspecific
(the largest epigastric lymph node measured 19 mm). PET-CT scan
___ showed FDG avid esophageal mass with mildly FDG avid 
left
diaphragmatic and subdiaphragmatic lymph nodes. 

Staging EGD/EUS ___ showed an exophytic esophageal mass at
the lower third of the esophagus (5cm long). It was staged as T3
by EUS criteria. There was one small ___ lymph node
(0.44x0.5cm) which was not sampled since the FNA would have had
to go through the tumor risking contamination. Two celiac lymph
nodes concerning for malignant involvement (0.57x0.32cm &
1.03x0.76cm) were seen. The larger celiac LN was sampled and
found to contain metastasis. He was therefore staged as having
T3N2 disease.

He completed chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced 
esophageal cancer and 
his PET-CT scan was performed on ___.  This study
demonstrated decreased FDG avidity at the site of the known
primary esophageal cancer.  ___ addition, the gastrohepatic
lymphadenopathy has also decreased ___ size and avidity.  There
was no evidence of metastatic disease.  The radiologist noted a
new irregular opacity ___ the right lower lung.  We reviewed this
___ our multidisciplinary conference and feel that this is likely
inflammatory or infectious. He presents now for an 
esophagectomy.

Pertinent Results:
___ CT Abd/pelvis :
1.  Postsurgical changes related to esophagectomy. No 
extraluminal oral 
contrast to suggest a leak. 
2.  New ill-defined hepatic hypodensities ___ segments II and 
___ reflect  retraction injury, new since the preoperative 
exam ___. 
3.  Small to moderate amount of simple free fluid ___ the abdomen 
and pelvis. No drainable fluid collection or evidence of abscess 
formation. 
4.  Stable appearance of renal and hepatic hypodensities, which 
are too small to characterize and are most likely cysts. 

___ Chest CT :
1.  Postsurgical changes related to esophagectomy and gastric 
pull-through. Oral material is seen throughout the neoesophagus. 
No extraluminal oral contrast to suggest a leak. 
2.  Moderate bibasilar consolidations, may represent infection 
or aspiration. 
3.  Small left and trace right nonhemorrhagic pleural effusions. 

  
___ CXR :
___ comparison with the study of earlier ___ this date, the right 
hemidiaphragm is not as sharply seen.  This raises the 
possibility of some effusion and atelectasis at the right base.  
Extensive left basilar 
opacification consistent with fluid and volume loss ___ the lower 
lobe is again noted.  Monitoring and support devices are 
essentially unchanged. 
  
___ CXR 
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal 
increase ___ 
vascular diameters and a minimal increase ___ the extent of a 
small left 
pleural effusion.  Unchanged are the positions of the monitoring 
and support devices as well as the moderate cardiomegaly and the 
overall low lung volumes. No new focal parenchymal opacities 
suggesting pneumonia.

___ CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Redemonstration of segment ___ hepatic parenchymal 
hypodensity, likely 
representing retraction injury.  Stable hepatic hypodensities 
most likely 
representing cysts or biliary hamartomas. 
2. Left renal cystic lesion with posterior hyperdensity, 
possibly representing layering hemorrhagic or proteinaceous 
contents, can be assessed for expected stability at  followup. 
3. Please refer to dedicated chest CT of same date for 
discussion of thoracic findings including right sided 
hydropneumothorax. 

___ Chest CT :
As compared to the previous examination, there is a new 
subcarinal fluid collection with air bubbles.  New pleural 
effusions.  
Unchanged right pneumothorax and small amount of retrocrural 
air.  At the time of dictation and observation, 3:10 p.m. on the 
___, the findings were discussed with the 
referring surgeon, Dr. ___. 

___ Ba swallow :
Contained leak was demonstrated at the level of carina. The 
location of the leak corresponds to the location of fluid 
collection as seen on the CT chest ___ 

___ CXR :
No relevant change as compared to the previous radiograph, the 
lung volumes have minimally increased, likely reflecting 
improved ventilation. However, mild pulmonary edema and remnant 
atelectasis at the lung bases persist.  The radiodense material 
projecting over the mediastinum is constant ___ distribution. 
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly 

___ Ba swallow :
A persistent contained leak was demonstrated.

___ CXR :
___ comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a 
slightly 
better inspiration.  The cardiac silhouette remains mildly 
enlarged.  There is little if any elevation and pulmonary venous 
pressure. Bibasilar atelectatic changes and small effusions 
persist.  The Port-A-Cath again extends to the mid portion of 
the SVC.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the hospital and taken to the 
Operating Room where he underwent a minimally-invasive 
___ esophagectomy, buttressing of intrathoracic 
anastomosis with thymus, laparoscopic jejunostomy feeding tube 
and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  He tolerated the procedure well 
and returned to the SICU intubated and ___ stable condition.  He 
remained intubated and sedated for several days post op as he 
required some diuresis but unfortunately he developed bibasilar 
consolidations as well as fevers and he was treated with 
antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia. He also developed atrial 
fibrillation and was treated with IV Diltiazem for rate control. 
 His creatinine rose to 1.7 post op but returned to normal with 
more hydration and withholding diuretics. Delirium was also an 
issue and he was treated with Seroquel which was effective. 
Eventually his pre op lithium was resumed and his mental status 
returned to normal. I will do a systems review for completeness 
sake.

Pulmonary :  Mr. ___ spent 10 days on the ventilator with 
weaning problems due to some fluid overload, possible aspiration 
pneumonia and severe agitation when sedation was weaned down.  
He had a bronchoscopy done on ___ to help clear his 
secretions and he was also placed on his pre op lithium which 
eventually made weaning of his sedation easier and he was 
extubated on ___.  He continued to need vigorous pulmonary 
toilet with chest ___, nebulizers and incentive spirometry and he 
was able to maintain his oxygen saturations > 95% with O2 at ___ 
LPM.  He currently is off of oxygen with room air saturations of 
97% but still requires nebulizer treatment to help clear his 
secretions.

Cardiac:  He developed rapid atrial fibrillation on post op day 
#1 which initially caused some hypotension.  He was treated with 
a Diltiazem drip and eventually IV metoprolol once his blood 
pressure allowed. His medications were switched to via the J 
tube and currently he remains ___ atrial fib/flutter anywhere 
from 70-110.  He's generally under 100 but does occasionally 
increase if he ambulates or does anything exertional.  His 
Diltiazem is 120 mg TIF and his lopressor is 50 mg TID with BP 
130/61 and HR as stated earlier.  Troponins have been checked 
during periods of RAF and have always been negative. He 
initially began anticoagulation with IV heparin and Coumadin but 
has been switched to Lovenox as he has an anastomotic leak and 
may need further invasive procedures. He will eventually ne able 
to transition to Coumadin when he's allowed to take medications 
orally.  He will also need a referral to cardiology following 
discharge.

GI: Mr. ___ had a J tube placed at the time of surgery and has 
received 100% of his nutrition via the J tube post op.  He 
tolerated Promote (no fiber) at his goal rate and began cycled 
feedings about a week ago.  He's receiving Promote at 130 mls/hr 
over 18 hrs from 3PM to 9AM.  From a surgical standpoint he 
developed fevers post op 4 to 102 and underwent a CT Torso which 
ruled out an anastomotic leak.  He was pan cultured and all were 
negative.  His JP drain and chest tube were eventually removed 
after an EGD on ___ showed no anastomotic leak and he did 
not have any leukocytosis. He had a bedside swallow done on 
___ which he passed.  He developed another temperature spike 
on ___ and had a repeat CT Torso which demonstrated some new 
pleural effusions as well as some air bubbles around the 
anastomosis, concerning for leak. Again, conservative treat was 
done including remaining NPO and broad spectrum antibiotic 
coverage.  He underwent a barium swallow on ___ which 
confirmed an anastomotic leak.  This prompted evaluation by the 
GI service and on ___ he was taken to the GI suite and had 
an EGD with placement of a Cook clip to ablate the fistulous 
tract around the anastomosis.  Unfortunately he decompensated 
post EGD, initially with rapid atrial firillation, desaturation 
and some complaints of shortness of breath.  He was transferred 
back to the ICU and improved with IV Diltiazem.  Once his heart 
rate was under control his SOB resolved and he improved.  
Currently he remains NPO as a barium swallow was done on ___ 
which again demonstrated a leak.  He will remain NPO and will 
return for a repeat swallow on ___ to determine the next 
course.

Neuro:  Although he had problems with delirium early post op, he 
has totally cleared and is only on his Lithium.  He has 
expressed concerns that he's not sleeping well and our 
medication choices were limited as elixir is not available here 
___ any sleeping medication other than Benedryl.  Sublingual 
Ativan was tried earlier (0.5mg) to decrease his anxiety but 
it's unclear how helpful it was.  He's very anxious to improve 
his strength and endurance so that he can get on with his life.

GU:  He had a brief increase ___ his creatinine from his baseline 
of 0.9 preop to 1.7 post op lasting ___ days but this resolved 
and has not been an issue for weeks.  His creatinine today is 
0.8.  He has not had any issues with voiding post foley removal.

ID:  Mr. ___ has been on multiple antibiotics at different 
times  post op for aspiration pneumonia.  All of his cultures 
have been negative except some GPC's ___ a BAL gram stain from 
___ but the culture was negative.  He's currently on 
Augmentin suspension via his J tube which was started to treat a 
possible aspiration on ___ and should continue thru 
___.  He has had no temperature spikes ___ 5 days and his 
WBC is 10K today.

After a long, protracted hospital course Mr. ___ will be 
discharged to rehab for vigorous Physical Therapy to help him 
regain his strength and eventual independence.  He will follow 
up ___ the Thoracic Clinic ___ 2 weeks.
