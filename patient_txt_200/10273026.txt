CT head ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Enlarging right occipital and parietal intraparenchymal 
hemorrhage with 
extension into the ventricle and extension into the subarachnoid 
space. No 
shift of midline structures or herniation is evident. A brain 
MRI is 
recommended to rule out underlying hemorrhagic tumor or 
infarction. 
2. No actively bleeding vessel identified on the technically 
limited CTA. 
3. Atherosclerotic disease involving the bilateral vertebral and 
cavernous 
carotid arteries.

CT head ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. Stable overall appearance of hemorrhage with some 
redistribution of blood products into the contralateral 
occipital horn of the lateral ventricle. 
2. Stable mass effect causing effacement of the right occipital 
horn of the lateral ventricle. No evidence of shift of midline 
structures or herniation. 
3. Areas of unchanged hypodensity within the hemorrhage must be 
followed 
closely for stability, as extension of these regions would 
represent active bleeding/ adjacent edema. Further workup for 
underlying cause as clinically indicated. 

CXR ___:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring 
and support 
devices are in unchanged position. The left hemidiaphragm is not 
as sharply seen, consistent with volume loss in the left lower 
lobe combined with small effusion. In the appropriate clinical 
setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service on ___ as a 
transfer from ___. Repeat CT showed enlarging R 
occipital hemorrhage. EVD was placed. INR was reversed with 1u 
of FFP and 10mg of Vit K. Given her declining neurologic status 
and poor prognosis, a family meeting was held and the decision 
was made to make the pt CMO. EVD was removed, she was extubated 
and transferred to the neurology floor. She was started on a 
morphine drip and hyoscyamine patch, and was then transitioned 
to a dilaudid drip along with prn ativan IV for respiratory 
distress. She passed away comfortably at ___ on ___. Family 
declined autopsy.
