CHEST (PA & LAT)Study Date of ___
Comparison to ___.  Stable elevation of the right 
hemidiaphragm. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  Bilateral 
pleural effusions are better visualized on the lateral than on 
the frontal image.  The effusions are restricted to the dorsal 
costophrenic sinuses.  No pneumonia, no pulmonary
edema.

TTE ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is mildly 
enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial septal defect by 
2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 
>15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy 
with a normal cavity size. There is normal regional and global 
left ventricular systolic function. The visually estimated left 
ventricular ejection fraction is >=55%. Left ventricular cardiac 
index is normal (>2.5 L/min/m2). There is no resting left 
ventricular outflow tract gradient. Tissue Doppler suggests an 
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP greater than 
18 mmHg). Mildly dilated right ventricular cavity with normal 
free wall motion. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion 
(TAPSE) is normal. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for 
gender with mildly dilated ascending aorta. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve 
stenosis. There is mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve 
prolapse. There is mild to moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. 
The pulmonic valve leaflets are normal. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is SEVERE [4+] 
tricuspid regurgitation. There is SEVERE pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/ global biventricular systolic 
function. Elevated PCWP. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to 
moderate mitral regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation 
and severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior TTE (images not available for review) of

good adherence to medication regimen and sodium restricted diet. 
Likely a combination of worsening renal function +/- severe 
tricuspid regurgitation (though it's likely that the TR appeared 
more severe in setting of volume overload). It is also possible 
that placement of his AV fistula contributed to his acute HF 
decompensation. Patient was diuresed with IV lasix boluses and 
he was transitioned to a PO regimen of Torsemide 60mg daily. 
Home amlodipine and carvedilol were continued. Weight at 
discharge was 203.2 lb (92.17 kg).

# CKD. 
Baseline creatinine around 4.3, etiology likely combination of 
oxalate nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive 
nephropathy. AVF placed ___ and undergoing renal transplant 
workup. Currently inactive on transplant list as will require 
cor angio prior to transplant. Patient deferring this until he 
progresses to requiring HD. No current indication for dialysis 
during this admission. We reached out to the transplant team who 
evaluated patient's fistula and did not need any additional 
studies. Cr on discharge was 5.5.

# A fib/atypical Aflutter s/p DCCV on ___
CHADS2VASC 4. INR supratherapeutic on presentation at 3.8. 
Continued home carvedilol and warfarin. He underwent a 
successful DCCV on ___ and remained in NSR on discharge. He 
will have follow up with Dr. ___ office in 1 month for 
further management. If he has recurrence of Aflutter in the 
future, he may benefit from an ablation.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
=========
This a ___ male patient with a history of CKD5 (Cr of 5.6, 
fistula in place, not currently on HD), afib on warfarin, HFpEF 
w/ severe TR, HTN, T2DM, HLD, and NASH who presents to the ED 
per referral from his cardiologist for hypotension. Of note, 
patient recently had extensive oral surgery in which all of his 
teeth were extracted and dental implants were placed. On initial 
presentation, patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBP in 
the ___ and anemic with Hb 7.1 (two point drop from prior Hb). 
He received boluses with IV fluids and received 1u of pRBCs. 
Initially also febrile to ___, so was started on broad spectrum 
IV antibiotics, with oral source presumed due to recent oral 
surgery. However, no recurrence of fever, blood cultures 
negative, UA and CXR clean, so antibiotics were discontinued. 
Patient started to experience bleeding from oral sites, OMFS 
consulted and placed sutures at bedside. Bleeding was controlled 
with sutures, pressure, and amikar rinses. Anticoagulation (for 
atrial fibrillation) was initially reversed with FFP and Vitamin 
K. After bleeding stopped, patient was bridged to warfarin with 
heparin. However, bleeding recurred, and heparin was 
discontinued. Bleeding was controlled with pressure and amikar 
rinses and patient received another 1 u pRBC transfusion. He 
remained hemodynamically stable during his admission and did not 
have recurrence of bleeding for 24 hours prior to discharge. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
============================
[] HELD: amlodipine and carvedilol
Recommend restarting based on blood pressure and PCP's clinical 
impression. 
[] CONTINUE: augmentin (to finish ___
[] Discharge INR: 1.3
[] Patient is at risk of oral bleeding, particularly once INR 
becomes therapeutic. Recommend monitoring INR and discussing 
anticoagulation with PCP/oral surgeon should bleeding recur. 
[] Patient is ordered for CBC and INR check on ___. 
Please ensure this is followed up on.
[] Patient should continue full liquid diet for 1 week (till 
___ after which he can try a soft food diet as tolerated. 
This can be changed based on discretion of oral surgeon. 

ACUTE ISSUES
===========
# Recent prolonged dental procedure w/post procedural bleeding.
# Acute on chronic anemia
Has a normocytic anemia with mild ___ at baseline. Receives 
ferraheme infusions as outpatient. Given two point drop in 
hemoglobin at presentation, patient received 1u of pRBCs. He 
spiked a fever during this transfusion (blood bank notified, 
patient stable). In addition, worsening bleeding from oral site 
on ___, which was initially treated with pressure at 
bleeding site with TXA soaked gauze and IV Vitamin K, FFP to 
reverse AC. Due to worsening bleeding on ___, H/H downtreneded 
to 5.9/19.5, patient received 2u pRBC/1u FFP/IV vitamin K. OMFS 
came to bedside to place sutures at sites of bleed. Patient 
developed hives during FFP transfusion which resolved following 
Benadryl (patient stable, blood bank notified). Patient started 
to bleed again on ___, likely following resuming 
anticoagulation (heparin to warfarin). Heparin was discontinued 
starting ___, patient received 1u of pRBC, bleeding controlled 
with holding pressure and amikar rinses. H/H stable on ___ 
with no evidence of recurrence of bleeding. Recommend continuing 
full liquid diet for 1 week to allow for healing of oral sites. 

# Concern for dental infection (resolved)
# Hypotension (resolved)
Patient had recent oral surgery without antibiotics 
pre-procedure, but was given Augmentin for 10 day course 
post-procedure. He became febrile the night of admission with 
fevers to 102 and was broadened to vancomycin and unasyn. In 
addition, hypotension at the same time resolved with 1L IVF 
bolus. Lactate remained normal. He was also receiving 1u pRBC 
transfusion at the time of fever. BPs have since stabilized. 
Patient has remained afebrile since admission with BC NGTD > 
48hrs, UA clear. Unasyn was discontinued and patient resumed 
augmentin to finish initial 10 day course (last day ___. 


# Persistent atrial fibrillation on warfarin
The patient has a history of rate controlled chronic atrial 
fibrillation and atypical flutter. While hospitalized recently 
he was found to be in typical atrial flutter and underwent DCCV. 
Initially was in RVR possibly secondary to hypotension or beta 
blocker withdrawal. He was restarted on metoprolol rather than 
carvedilol in the setting of low blood pressure. He has no acute 
indications for bridging with heparin at this time. CHA2DS2-VASc 
___. Recommend continuing home warfarin. Discharge INR 1.3.

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
# ESRD undergoing renal transplant workup
ESRD is secondary to oxalate nephropathy, hypertension and 
diabetes. Not currently on HD, L. forearm AV fistula mature in 
case needs to be used. He currently has no uremic symptoms and 
electrolytes stable so no urgent needs for HD.

# HFpEF with severe TR and pHTN
Home diuretics initially held; resumed prior to discharge. 

# Type 2 Diabetes
Held home glipizide while in house and maintained on weight 
based insulin regimen.

# Hypertension 
Held amlodipine in the setting of hypotension. Metoprolol 
started in place of carvedilol to avoid vasodilatory effects. 

# Osteomyelitis ___ left great toe status post course of 
IV antibiotics as well as amputation 
R foot appears well healed with no signs of infection.
