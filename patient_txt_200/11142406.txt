Initial Consult HPI:

to

Hosp course includes being given activated charcoal and
monitoring in ICU for possibility of acute CNS depression.  Pt

depressed about many things in her life, including having no
friends she feels close to in ___, problems with her 
roommate,
problems with her boyfriend (as she was unfaithful to him
recently), stress ___ a project due for her summer internship,
and working a part-time job. She came home feeling anxious and
took her normal dose of 0.5mg Clonazepam as needed for anxiety. 
She started to feel better, but wanted to feel better for a
longer period of time, and thus steadily took more pills one by
one.  She began to feel more hopeless and depressed about the
many stressors in her life and just wanted to sleep, it was then
that she took "the whole bottle."  She states she did not want 
to
actually die as result of the ingestion, rather she just wanted
"to make things better by sleeping."   She states she has been
depressed recently, but that she has been depressed and suicidal
her whole life.  She denies  any plans to commit suicide prior 
to
the ingestion.  
.
She has a history of cutting and burning, but has not cut in 
over
a year. She has not any urges to cut or burn recently.  She
denies any sleeping problems, denies changes in concentration,
and her energy varies (sometimes she feels like she can
accomplish a lot, some says she is tired).  She denies any
decreased need for sleep, increased spending, or grandiosity.
Denies any AH/VH/IOR/IOP.  She is not concerned for her safety
right now, and does not feel suicidal.  
.
She states she does not want to commit suicide now because it 
has
caused her a lot of stress, as she has project to complete, and
is supposed to attend a meeting tomorrow morning for her
internship.  In addition, her boyfriend is now angry with her,
although he does not yet know about her recent infidelity.  She
feels very guilty about this, and furthermore has been
emotionally rejected by the man with whom she cheated.   She
feels alone and abandoned by him, which further upsets her.  She
has felt very lonely in ___, as she is barely on speaking
terms with her roommates.   She states the friends she has made
here are were very mean, and talked behind her back.  "I've
always had trouble making friends," she states.  
Of notes she states her depression has been getting worse for 
the
past year given her social problems, and  states that
occasionally she feels calm, but equates this more as "a calm
before a storm."  She is not hopeful that things will improve 
for
her. 
.
.
Initial Inpatient Floor HPI:
Pt is a ___ yo woman with h/o social anxiety disorder and likely 
borderline personality disorder who presented to ___ on 
___ s/p OD on Klonopin.  She was admitted to the medical 
floor initially to monitor respiratory status and then 
subsequently transferred to Deac 4 for safety, stablilization, 
and psychopharm evaluation.  
The patient reports that she came home from her internship on 
___ and felt "out of it and anxious" and therefore decided 
to take 1 Klonopin pill.  A ___ hour later, she did not feel 
much better so she took another pill.  After about an hour, she 
did not feel better and then decided impulsively to take the 
whole pill bottle.  She is not able to recall whether she wanted 
to die at that time but rather is able to recall that she wanted 
to be able to sleep.  She reports many social stressors that 
were causing her to feel anxious including her relationship with 
her boyfriend on whom she recently cheated, her overbearing boss 
at work, having to move soon, no close friends, and having a 
paper due for her summer internship.  She reports that these 
have been stressors for her for a while and that sometimes she 
feels a "calm, but not a good calm.  It is as iff I don't feel 
anything; that I am not aware of things/people around me."  
She reports that she has had no times for things recently due to 
her 2 jobs.  She reports that, for this reason, she has been 
unable to do things that she enjoys, which include exploring 
___ and going out to lunch.  She reports that her energy is 
on/off and that her concentration is okay at work but not 
otherwise.  Sleep has been good due to her always being tired 
and her appetite has been good.  She denies manic symptoms 
currently or in the past, believing that her diagnosis of 
bipolar disorder given to her by a psychiatrist at ___ has no 
merit.  
When asked about her anxiety symptoms, the patient reports that 
she is anxious mostly in social situations.  She hates parties 
she reports.  She reports that she often feels anxious when she 
is alone but not in the same way--she describes it as a 
depression.  She has had 1 panic attack in the past (last

arm.  She reports that she "invests a lot in people" and has 
poor relationships with others.  She gets irritated quickly and 
spends time crying and yelling when that happens.  She reports 
that she often feels abandoned by people.
