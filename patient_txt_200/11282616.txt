CTA neck ___
MPRESSION:
1. Per NASCET criteria there is approximately 50% stenosis at 
the origin of the right internal carotid artery and a 0% 
stenosis at the origin of left internal carotid artery. There is 
a large ulcerated plaque at the right internal carotid artery 
origin and a minimal ulceration at the origin of the left 
internal carotid artery.

2. There are mild stenoses elsewhere.

cta neck ___
IMPRESSION:
1. There is very mild atherosclerotic disease of the anterior 
circulation without a tight focal stenosis. The posterior 
circulation looks grossly normal.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on 
Xarelto, HTN, HLD, NPH s/p VPS who presents with a temporary 
episode of speech difficulties. She was unable to speak for a 
few minutes, with retained awareness. She had returned to 
baseline prior to presenting to the ED and was at baseline 
during her hospitalization. Her neurological exam was notable 
for impaired short term recall ___ but otherwise unremarkable. 
Her speech was intact. She had a CTA h/n which showed ulcerated 
plaque in the R ICA. However as she is R handed, it was not felt 
this was related to her symptoms. She was seen by vascular 
surgery. From a stroke perspective it was not felt that 
intervention on the R ICA stenosis, which was < 50% would be 
indicated, as this was not felt to be the symptomatic side. MRI 
was ordered, but not completed, as her VPS was not MRI 
compatible. As the likelihood of stroke was felt to be low, MRI 
was not felt to be essential. It was felt that a TIA seemed 
somewhat less likely, given that she had a similar episode 
earlier in the week. We did recommend she change her Xarelto to 
with dinner instead of breakfast for better absorption, but afib 
would not be expected to cause stereotyped events. Routine EEG 
was ordered to assess for risk of seizures, but not able to be 
completed inpatient. As she had a flight back home, we did not 
prolong hospitalized to obtain a routine EEG, she should have 
this done outpatient. She did show some evidence of sundowning 
while hospitalized, reporting seeing dripping water in the 
evening, when none present.

#bradycardia - she had asymptomatic bradycardia while 
hospitalized, with HR < 50 at times. She was seen by cardiology 
who recommended stopping metoprolol. She was in Mobitz 1 per 
cardiology. They did not recommend any further intervention, no 
need for pacemaker.

#UTI - UA with 22 WBC, she did not report dysuria, but has poor 
short term memory. UCx contaminated. Plan to treat with 
cefpodoxime 100 mg BID x 5days.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

#aphasic episode - routine EEG outpatient. Xarelto timing 
changed to dinner.

#bradycardia - type ___ Mobitz - stopped metoprolol. f/u 
cardiology outpatient

#UTI - finish cefpodoxime course (total 5 days), end date ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ were hospitalized for symptoms of a period of time where ___ 
were not able to speak. ___ had a similar episode earlier in the 
week. ___ had testing with CTA of the head and neck. This did 
not show a reason for your speech issue. We planned on doing a 
MRI, but due to your VPS we could not. We had planned on 
obtaining a routine EEG, however, we were not able to have this 
done in the hospital prior to discharge. ___ should have this 
done as an outpatient once ___ return home to ___. Your 
heart rate was low while ___ were in the hospital. ___ were seen 
by the cardiologists who recommended that ___ stop metoprolol, 
they did not think ___ needed a pacemaker. Please see a 
cardiologist after going home. 

Your urine showed evidence of inflammation, so ___ were given 
antibiotics for a possible urinary infection. ___ have a few 
days of antibiotics left.

We thought it was less likely ___ had a TIA, although it is 
possible. Usually a TIA would not have the exact same symptoms 
without evolving further or stopping. We recommend ___ take the 
Xarelto at night with dinner instead of with breakfast, as ___ 
need at least a 500 calorie meal to be able to fully absorb this 
medicine. A seizure is a possibility but does not seem too 
likely, this can be assessed with an outpatient EEG. There are 
no special precautions to take for your flight home.

Sincerely,
Your ___ neurology team
