The case complexity required a multidisciplinary approach with 
Cardiac Surgery 
and Interventional Cardiology. 
Vascular access was obtained in left common femoral using

The left femoral artery was used to advance a ___ Fr Pigtail 
catheter to the right coronary sinus. 
A ___ Fr temporary pacemaker was placed in the right ventricle 
from the left femoral vein through a 
long ___ Fr sheath. 
Vascular access was obtained in the right femoral artery using

Discharge Instructions:
 You were admitted for a trans catheter aortic valve replacement 
(TAVR) to treat your aortic valve stenosis which was done on 
___. By repairing the valve your heart can pump blood more 
easily and your shortness of breath should improve. It was noted 
that you had an abnormal heart rhythm during the procedure that 
has now resolved.  

 It is very important to take all of your heart healthy 
medications. In particular, you are now taking Aspirin and 
Clopidogrel (Plavix). These medications help to prevent blood 
clots from forming on the new valve. If you stop these 
medications or miss ___ dose, you risk causing a blood clot 
forming on your new valve. This could cause it to malfunction 
and it may be life threatening. Please do not stop taking 
Aspirin or Plavix without taking to your heart doctor, even if 
another doctor tells you to stop the medications.  

 You will need prophylactic antibiotics prior to any dental 
procedure. Please inform your dentist about your recent cardiac 
procedure, and obtain a prescription from your doctor before any 
procedure. 
 Please weigh yourself every day in the morning after you go to 
the bathroom and before you get dressed. If your weight goes up 
by more than 3 lbs in 1 day or more than 5 lbs in 3 days, please 
call your heart doctor or your primary care doctor and alert 
them to this change. Your weight at discharge is 121 pounds.

You will wear a monitor a home called a Ziopatch for a few weeks 
to make sure that you remain in a normal rhythm. 
 
 We have made changes to your medication list, so please make 
sure to take your medications as directed. You will also need to 
have close follow up with your heart doctor and your primary 
care doctor.  
 If you have any urgent questions that are related to your 
recovery from your procedure or are experiencing any symptoms 
that are concerning to you and you think you may need to return 
to the hospital, please call the ___ Heart Line at 
___ to speak to a cardiologist or cardiac nurse 
practitioner.
  
 It has been a pleasure to have participated in your care and we 
wish you the best with your health.  

 
Followup Instructions:
