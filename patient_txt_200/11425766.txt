============================
#IMAGING/OTHER STUDIES: 
CT ___ without contrast (___): 
1. No fracture or acute traumatic malalignment. 2. Severe 
degenerative changes within the cervical spine, similar compared 
to prior, as described above. Moderate to severe spinal canal 
narrowing at ___. 3. 1.5 cm hypodense nodule within right lobe 
of the thyroid. Thyroid ultrasound is recommended.

___ CT head (___): 
1. There is a hyperdense subdural hematoma abutting the right 
tentorial leaflet measuring up to 2 mm. While this was not seen 
on CT head ___, this is likely due to redistribution 
from patient's other foci of intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Right 
frontal subdural hematoma and left frontal subarachnoid hematoma 
are decreased in size from ___. 

CXR (___): 
Focal opacity at the left lung base which could represent 
pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. 

Left wrist/hand ___ (___): 
1. No acute fracture. 2. As seen on recent prior study, there 
are severe degenerative changes as previously detailed. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of major 
neurocognitive disorder, orthostatic hypotension, osteoporosis, 
recent admission for fall complicated by subdural hematoma now 
presenting with altered mental status. 

# Encephalopathy 
# Major cognitive decline: 
Patient with history of significant cognitive decline likely due 
to late onset Alzheimer disease. Per prior notes, AOx1 at 
baseline. Cognitive decline complicated by impulsive behavior, 
agitation at night. Patient presented with question of acute on 
chronic encephalopathy as manifested by increased lethargy, new 
behaviors (such as eating with hands and not utensils), as well 
as no longer recognizing family members. Although difficult to 
exclude progression of underlying advanced Alzheimer's, 
particularly in setting of recent SDH, the acuity of the change 
in addition to features of waxing/waning alertness is consistent 
with a superimposed delirium. While patient does have a history 
NSCE, patient without witnessed unresponsive episodes. NCHCT 
this admission with evolving prior SDH and SAH but no acute 
process. CXR with LLL opacity but patient without clinical 
evidence of pneumonia. No fevers or leukocytosis, and no 
apparent signs or symptoms of overt infection, however, in 
setting of advanced dementia, eliciting symptoms was 
challenging. She seemed back to baseline mental status (oriented 
to person only) and energy level (accordingly to family 
including granddaughter who is HCP) at discharge.  Her home 
Tramadol was held during admission due to concern that it could 
be causing drowsiness and not resumed on discharge.  She did not 
appear to be in pain and plan was discussed with her healthcare 
proxy to discuss the Tramadol further with PCP.

#Urinary tract infection:
Given her markedly positive UA, and possible endorsement of 
urinary frequency, she was initiated on Ceftriaxone for 
treatment of UTI. Urine Cx ultimately grew Strep Bovis and she 
completed a five day course of Ceftriaxone on ___.  She had 
no reported symptoms, but eliciting history was extremely 
difficult due to her dementia, so it was difficult to follow 
clinical response.  She remained afebrile without leukocytosis.

# Recent fall with subdural hematoma: 
___ this admission with evolution of hematoma, thought to be 
due to redistribution of blood products. Overall SDH resorbing 
and no evidence of mass efffect. She completed a 7 day course of 
Keppra for seizure ppx. SDH thought to be unlikely cause of AMS 
as noted interval improvement on CT scans. Some component of 
increased lethargy may be due to side effect of keppra, which 
she is now no longer taking as of ___. 

# Wrist swelling: 
Patient's left wrist and fingers were edematous. Neurovascularly 
intact, motor function grossly intact (patient squeezes to 
command). No apparent pain or tenderness. Per ACS note from 
prior admission, patient had swelling of left third finger. No 
evidence of cellulitis. No fracture on admission ___. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
# Orthostatic hypotension: Encouraged oral hydration and she was 
continued on home fludricortisone.  Home salt tabs were held and 
recommended to discuss with her PCP on discharge.

# Osteoporosis: 
Patient is followed as outpatient by endocrinology. On Prolia 
every 6 months. Continued home calcium and vitamin D. 

# Subclinical Hypothyroidism: 
# Thyroid nodules: 
She was noted on prior imaging to have multinodular thyroid 
gland for which thyroid ultrasound was recommended for further 
evaluation, however, given patient's age and cognitive decline 
this was not pursued. TSH within normal limits. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
==================
- Advised patient's HCP to discuss the salt tabs and Tramadol 
with PCP
- ___ was discharged home with home ___.  ___ had recommended 
rehab, but her HCP (after long discussion) decided home with 
services would be better.
- Confirmed with her HCP (granddaughter) ___ that 
the patient is DNR/DNI.  MOLST was completed.
- Blood cultures from admission ___ were still not finalized 
at discharge, but had no growth to date as of ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a privilege to care for you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted for worsening lethargy and 
confusion. After an extensive workup, the only possible etiology 
determined to explain your symptoms is a urinary tract 
infection. You were treated with antibiotics for 5 days and 
seemed to have improvement in confusion and energy level.

Please continue to take all medications as prescribed. We 
recommend no longer taking the medication tramadol as this 
medication can cause confusion and lethargy in some people. 

You were also evaluated by physical therapy due to history of 
falls and we are setting you up to have physical therapy in your 
home.  You had wrist pain but fortunately an ___ showed there 
was no fracture.

We wish you the best!

Sincerely, 
Your ___ team

Brief Hospital Course:
___ presented to the ED with fever of 102 after recent d/c from 
rehab after previous hosptialization for c. diff colitis s/p 3 
days of cipro for UTI, who presented with severe sepsis and 
shock now with hypotention and lactic acidosis.

#Severe Complicated C. diff collitis and Septic shock: Patient 
was febrile, hypotensive with leukocytosis, diarrhea and lactate 
of 3.0 upon presentation in setting of previous history of c. 
diff s/p 3 days of ciprofloxacin for UTI. In the ED she was 
given IV vanc, zosyn and flagyl. On the floor she was switched 
to flagyl IV, vancomycin PO and ceftriaxone (to treat a ?UTI). 
C. Diff PCR was positive and urine culture were negative. Blood 
cultures were NGTD. Her fever, leukocytosis, lactate and 
hypotension all improved with fluid boluses of LR and 
antibiotics and the patient did not require any pressors. Flagyl 
was stopped on ___. Given first recurrence of severe c diff, is 
to complete a 14d course of antibiotics to complete ___.

#Altered Mental Status: Upon admission, the patient was slightly 
confused, however oriented x3. The evening of ___ the patient 
was given seroquel for insomnia and became agitated. During the 
afternoon on ___, the patient became very agitated, demanding 
that she be let outside. She was given haldol 2.5 IV x2. With 
resolution of above metabolic abnormalities, this returned to 
baseline. She has resumed her home low dose qhs mirtazapine on 
discharge. 

#Acute Kidney Injury: Although Cr was 1.0 on presentation, given 
patient's age and weight her calculated GFR was 27. Secondary to 
pre-renal azotemia given diarrhea as above. Cr improved with 
IVF. Discharge cr 0.6. 

#Hyponatremia: Hypovolemic hyponatremia from diarrhea. Improved 
with administration of NS. Discharge Na 136.

#Fall: No LOC, no head trauma. NCHCT negative. Occured with 
change in position. Pre-syncope from hypovolemia.

# chronic anemia: presented initially with hemoconcentration, 
but with fluids hct returned to baseline (___) and remained 
stable thereafter (discharge hct 27.7). Previous w/u has 
included iron studies, B12, folate, which has been potentially 
c/w anemia of chronic disease versus CKD-related. Consideration 
can be made for checking an epo level as an outpatient. 

# incidental findings: 
# baseline severe spinal stenosis: known to have severe lumbar 
spinal stenosis, and had been considering injections for pain as 
an outpatient. Imaging here demonstrated severe spinal stenosis 
(which could put her at risk for spinal injury with trauma) in 
cervical area here, but asymptomatic from that perspective. 
Consideration can be made as an outpatient to consider further 
workup and management, though given age and co-morbidity and 
goals of care, surgical intervention seems unlikely to be 
beneficial. 

# compression fx v burst fx on vertebral imaging: on home 
vitamin D with recent level wnl, Ca wnl. Has already been 
ordered for outpatient BMD imaging by PCP. Can consider 
bisphosphonate pending results as an outpatient.

rehab with altered mental status, found to have cefepime 
toxicity secondary to ___ complicated by nonconvulsive status 
epilepticus.  
Ms. ___ was initially admitted to ___ 
___ on ___ with right hip pain. A lumbar spine 
MRI demonstrated severe degenerative joint disease and discitis 
at the level of L3-L4. Patient underwent CT guided biopsy, 
however cultures did not grow an organism. ID was consulted, and 
she was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime with plans for a 
course ending ___.  
Patient was discharged to rehab ___, was put on standing 
ibuprofen, and was transferred to Epoch ___ as the family felt 
she was not progressing in therapy and they were also concerned 
that patient had developed mild confusion.  
At Epoch, she was evaluated by the ___ MD ___ who noted that 
she was very mildly confused but animated and alert. Per 
records, patient had become increasingly confused over the past 
two days. Her Cr was noted to have increased to 2.9 on ___ with 
BUN of 45 from 0.9 the week prior. A foley was placed due to 
concern for retention and 600cc of urine were removed. Despite 
this, patient continued to have poor urine output and developed 
worsening confusion, twitching, myoclonus, and weakness. There 
was concern for cefepime toxicity, and her cefepime was dose 
reduced to 1gm q12h on ___. Vancomycin was held on ___ due to 
worsening renal function. Of note, Vanc trough ___ was 18 and 
20.6 on ___. Over the past two days, she has also developed a 
new oxygen requirement. Given progressive lethargy and decline 
in mental status, she was referred to the ED.  
In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.8 92 119/73 18 95% 3L. Labs 
were significant for BUN/Cr 49/3.0, anion gap of 15, albumin 
2.8, H/H 9.8/27.9 stable from 9.1/27.5 on ___, normal liver 
chemistries. Imaging revealed no acute intracranial process and 
left pleural effusion + atelectasis. The patient was given 1g 
vancomycin (vancomycin level 32), 1L NS and 500 mg azithromycin 
for pneumonia. She was noted to be minimally responsive, only 
withdrawing to painful stimuli in the ED, which was a 
progressive change from earlier in the evening. Vitals prior to 
transfer were HR 93, 113/71, 18 95% 3L.  
Upon arrival to the ___, she only withdrew to light shined in 
her eye and moans to painful stimuli. Family shared that her 
decline has been progressive from their perspective over the 
past two weeks. Two weeks ago she had a brief trip away from

having trouble holding her fork, dropping things. On ___, the 
patient was speaking in gibberish and was twitching. She told 
her family that she was quite thirsty on ___. Patient had RASS 
-4 on Medicine floor. She had a 20 minute EEG with page to 
Medicine resident at 17:00 with read concerning for status 
epilepticus. In discussion with floor team, Neurology, and 
Nephrology, patient’s code status was reversed from DNR/DNI with 
hope to avoid dialysis to DNR and okay to intubate and perform 
HD with hope that her mental status could improve with HD/AEDs 
to reverse status epilepticus and cefepime toxicity.

+ ___ ECHO: 
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left 
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global 
systolic function are normal (biplane LVEF 66%). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Mild 
pulmonary artery hypertension. Increased PCWP. No valvular 
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

+ ___ Renal U/S:IMPRESSION:  
Essentially normal renal ultrasound with bilateral simple cyst. 
No evidence of hydronephrosis. 

+ CONTINUOUS EEG RECORDING: Began at 16:51 on the afternoon of ___ 
___ and
continued through 7:00 the following morning. From the 
beginning, it showed
very rhythmic generalized, frontally predominant sharp and slow 
wave
discharges recurring with a frequency of about 2.3 Hz. On video, 
there were
no clear signs of seizures such as focal motor jerking or 
blinking, but there
were independent reports of sporadic myoclonus. A diagnosis of 
non-convulsive
status epilepticus was made and communicated to the clinical 
team. There was
a marketed diminution in sharp wave discharges at about 19:45, 
likely the
result of medication administration. At that point, the 
background was a
slow, ___ Hz frequency in most areas with irregular and 
infrequent bursts of
generalized slowing or generalized sharp waves.
Of note, one pushbutton activation at 19:45 for the 
administration of 1
mg of lorazepam; another at 19:55 reported the beginning of the 
administration
of 500 mg of phenytoin. In the last half hour of the recording, 
the
background frequency improved to about 6 Hz posteriorly. 
Nevertheless,
rhythmic sharp wave activity recurred at 6:50 following morning, 
and a
pushbutton activation at that point reported the administration 
of 1 mg
lorazepam. Within a minute, the sharp waves ceased.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed the same high voltage sharp 
wave discharges
described above.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed some of the rhythmic sharp 
waves described
earlier.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were six, three of which are 
described above.
Another at 21:33 was for the administration of medication. There 
were no
changes in the EEG at this time or for the rest of the 
pushbutton activations
until the final one at 6:50. At 23:22, there was concern about 
posturing, but
the EEG did not change at that time.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleep patterns were evident.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured six pushbutton activations, 
as described
above. The beginning of the record showed very rhythmic sharp, 
high voltage
epileptiform discharges strongly suggestive of non-convulsive 
status
epilepticus. This responded quickly to low doses of lorazepam 
leaving a very
encephalopathic record. There were no prominent focal 
abnormalities but
encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. The discharges 
recurred at 6:50
and were treated promptly, again successfully.

K-3.4 Cl-102 HCO3-27 AnGap-___ on treatment for for discitis with vancomycin and cefepime, 
presented with progressive decline in mental status and found to 
be in non-convulsive status epilepticus, thought secondary to 
cefepime toxicity with nonconvulsive status epilepticus from 
NSAID-induced ___. 

# Altered Mental Status: Patient presented with altered mental 
status, myoclonus in the setting of cefepime use and acute renal 
failure. EEG on admission showed non-convulsive status 
epilepticus, a known complication of toxic levels of cefepime 
which can develop with renal failure. She was given 1mg of 
lorazepam, loaded with phenytoin and keppra which broke her 
seizure activity. She underwent hemodialysis with clearance of 
her mental status. She became alert and conversant with her 
family. Given that her seizures were thought to be a medication 
adverse effect and not from an underlying of seizure disorder, 
anti-epileptic medications were discontinued. 

# Acute Kidney Injury: Likely secondary to pre-renal secondary 
to NSAIDs/poor PO intake/vancomycin toxicity.  Urine chemistries 
on admission showed some evidence of acute tubular necrosis and 
poor sodium avidity.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable for 
post-renal pathology. Given patient experience of toxic side 
effect of cefepime, hemodialysis was initiated to help clear 
cefepime. She underwent multiple HD sessions with improvement in 
her mental status. Between sessions she had stable electrolytes 
but did have evidence of volume overload and rising creatinine. 
She continued to have ongoing renal function with ongoing urine 
output during admission. Given the stress of HD and evidence of 
persistent renal function, decision was made to not initiate 
long term hemodialysis. While hospitalized she was clinically 
monitored assessing her regularly for need for HD. Her last HD 
session was on ___ on day of discharge she had no need for HD. 
Her electrolytes were stable (except for elevated creatinine), 
she had ongoing urine output with stable oxygen requirement.

# Recent Diskitis: Ms. ___ was initially admitted to 
___ on ___ with right hip pain. A 
lumbar spine MRI demonstrated severe degenerative joint disease 
and discitis at the level of L3-L4. Patient underwent CT guided 
biopsy, however cultures did not grow an organism. ID was 
consulted, and she was started on Vancomycin and Cefepime with 
plans for a course ending ___. 
Obtained biopsy results from ___. E'___. Biospy was negative for 
growth. No antibiotics were given during hospitalization and 
patient had no evidence of infection.

# Anemia: Noted on admission, thought likely anemia of chronic 
disease from ?osteomyelitis/diskitis, versus anemia from CKD. 
Blood counts were stable during admission.

# Goals of Care: Patient has DNR/DNI form signed; family is very 
clear on pt's desire for conservative measures ruling out long 
term hemodialysis. At discharge her renal recovery was unclear. 
She had evidence of severely depressed renal function but with 
residual function. Given her unhappiness with medical setting 
decision was made to transfer to rehab with close geriatric 
followup while in rehab with possible transition to hospice care 
if she showed signs decline from renal failure.

TRANSITIONAL: 
- CXR ___: Asymmetric right upper lobe subpleural opacity but 
warrants re-evaluation with well positioned PA, lateral and 
apical lordotic radiographs, prior to discharge the to exclude 
active infection or malignancy. This was not done as it was felt 
that it was not within the patient's goals of care. If Goals of 
care change would recommend repeat CXR. 
- Would recommend transition to hospice (at home or at rehab) if 
patient declines from signs of renal failure
- can consider periodic monitoring of renal function going 
forward, with above goals of care in mind regarding need/desire 
for HD
- patient was not discharged on antibiotics as completed course 
for osteomyelitis
- patient was not discharged on anti-epileptics as presentation 
was thought to be secondary to cefepime toxicity and not 
intrinsic seizure disorder.

# CODE STATUS:  Do not resuscitate (DNR/DNI) NO ICU TRANSFER, NO 
BIPAP
# CONTACT:  ___ (granddaughter, HCP) ___

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure meeting you and taking care of you. You were 
admitted with renal failure and seizure activity that we thought 
was caused by a build up of a medication called cefepime in your 
blood. We gave you medications to treat your seizures, which 
resulted in an improvement in your mental state. We also 
performed hemodialyssis to help clear cefepime and support you 
while we gave your kidneys time to recover. Your kidneys showed 
some improvement but have not improved to your previous 
baseline. Given your desire to lead non-medicalized life that 
focused on your comfort and dignity, we are transferring you to 
a rehabilitation facility where the geriatrics team can continue 
to follow you and we can continue to address your comfort. 

We wish you the best, 

Your ___ team

granddaughter and friend present in room.

Pt in USOH until ___ afternoon. Had late lunch and went to 
park with family afterwards. Soon after getting out of car, was 
standing up and had ?rhythmic jerking of her UE and ___ with 
apparent LOC. Did not fall (has significant help with ambulating 
due to lumbar spinal stenosis). Lasted ~2min and then woke up 
with no residual cognitive or motor deficits. Not on any 
anti-hypertensives at home that she could have taken prior. Does
take tramadol and duloxetine in AM for lumbar spinal stenosis. 
Second episode occurred ___ AM while sitting on 
toilet. Per report, observed by caregiver again with similar 
movements and LOC with return to baseline immediately 
afterwards. No reported incontinence.

Pt emphatically endorses that she does not have as much PO fluid 
intake as much as she should. Per granddaughter, she drinks 1+ 
glasses of wine each day.

Of note, pt at baseline is dependent in all ADLs and IADLS, 
walks with a rolling walker and can only take a few steps on her 
own. She has lost 20lb since ___. Her memory currently is 
"terrible" per granddaughter; has declined considerably in past 
___ years.

Pt has constipation at baseline and has a home bowel reg which 
helps. No recent fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

PERTINENT IMAGING
-----------------
T-SPINE and L-SPINE Study Date of ___ 11:30 AM
FINDINGS: 
Thoracic spine.
There is mild multilevel degenerative discogenic change with 
disc space
narrowing and endplate spurring.  No aggressive focal bone 
lesion.  No acute compression fracture is seen.  Visualized 
lungs are unremarkable.  Lower cervical spine osteoarthritis is 
incompletely assessed on this exam.
 
Lumbar spine.
There are 5 non rib-bearing lumbar type vertebral bodies.  There 
is
dextroconvex scoliosis, apex at L4-5.  There is mild rightward 
listhesis of L4 respect to L5, and leftward listhesis of L3 
respect to L4.  L3 demonstrates moderate compression deformity, 
similar to previous MRI allowing for difference in technique.  
Severe multilevel degenerative discogenic changes throughout the 
lumbar spine are most marked at L2-3, and L3-4.  Mild bilateral 
hip joint space narrowing and osteophytosis.  No erosion.  No 
concerning bone lesion.  There is vascular calcification 
involving the abdominal aorta.  There
is straightening of the lumbar spine with loss of normal 
lordosis.  There is severe lower lumbar spine facet joint 
osteoarthritis.  Asymmetric lucency of the pubic bone on the AP 
view is noted, uncertain if this is artifactual.  Tiny linear 
density at the left greater trochanter may reflect sequela of 
calcific tendinitis.
 
IMPRESSION: 
-Degenerative changes as detailed above.  Moderate compression 
deformity of L3 similar to previous MRI allowing for difference 
in technique.
-Lucency at the left pubic bone could be artifactual.  Recommend 
correlation with dedicated pelvis radiograph.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a lovely ___ ___ speaking lady 
with hx of HTN, C.diff colitis, chronic sterile pyuria, and 
lumbar spinal stenosis who presented after 2 witnessed episodes 
of loss of consciousness along with bilateral jerking movements 
of her arms and legs, likely orthostatic syncope ___ hypovolemia 
from poor PO intake at home. Due to concern for seizure, 
Neurology was consulted in the ED. She received a head CT which 
was negative for acute intracranial pathologies. A spot EEG was 
done which showed no focal abnormalities or epileptiform 
discharges. She was monitored on telemetry and EKGs were 
obtained which only showed non-specific ST changes. She was 
found to have orthostatic hypotension which improved with IV 
fluids, though pt still had orthostatic vitals at time of 
discharge (likely her baseline). However, pt was clinically 
well-appearing. At the time of discharge, her orthostatic vital 
signs were BP 149/76 HR 91 lying down --> BP 100/61 HR 91 
standing. Work up, including AM cortisol, B12, A1c, TFTs, and 
spinal films were largely unremarkable. PEP, cortisol and RPR 
pending on d/c. She was discharged home with instructions to 
increase her water and salt intake, wear compression stockings, 
decrease her daily alcohol intake, and ambulate/exercise as much 
as tolerated. Her duloxetine was discontinued because it can 
contribute to her orthostasis and did not seem to help 
significantly with her spinal stenosis. We arranged for home ___ 
services for 1 week to obtain daily orthostatic vital signs as 
well as home physical therapy.

Ms. ___ was otherwise continued on her home medications 
during her stay with the exception of several dietary 
supplements which were not on forumlary.

Lastly, the patient's weight at discharge was 51 kg (112 lb).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Results pending on discharge: SPEP, UPEP, RPR
- Patient was started on fludrocortisone 0.1mg QAM for 
orthostatic hypotension. Will require potassium check ~1 week 
after discharge (___), to be drawn by ___. 
- Patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. She 
was previously seen by Dr. ___ at ___. 
We have scheduled her for follow-up.
- Patient would benefit from further workup for etiology of her 
orthostatic hypotension. She has been scheduled for follow-up in 
Dr. ___ clinic.
- Patient may benefit from downtitration of tramadol to reduce 
polypharmacy considering her age, frailty, cognitive impairment, 
and her reporting limited efficacy in relieving her pain.
- Patient may benefit from referral to pain clinic as 
nonsurgical treatment options for her lumbar spinal stenosis are 
limited.
- Patient complained of occasional pain on urination and 
possible genital wound. ___ benefit from gynecological 
evaluation.
- Consider formal cognitive testing (e.g. MOCA, MMSE) to 
evaluate and trend patient's reported recent cognitive decline.
- Incidental findings on imaging: Lucency at the left pubic bone 
could be artifactual. Recommend correlation
with dedicated pelvis radiograph.

hypoxia in setting of a fall requiring admission to the MICU for
hypoxia likely secondary to pulmonary edema, improved with 
diuresis and now on room air. Hospital course otherwise notable 
for L femoral neck fracture s/p ORIF and cystitis s/p abx 
course.
 
ACUTE ISSUES  
=============== 
#Hypoxia:
#Pulmonary Edema

Patient presented with elevated BNP and new oxygen requirement, 
requiring non rebreather in the ED that was quickly reduced to 4 
L nasal cannula. Patient BNP was elevated (___) and CXR showed 
significant pulmonary edema. CTA partially exonerated PE-- 
limited by respiratory
motion but no central PE. Patient O2 requirement decreased with 
fluid removal and was able to be weaned to room air at time of 
discharge. She experienced occasional desaturations on nasal 
cannula primarily in the setting of mouth breathing that 
immediately resolved on delivery of equivalent oxygen with face 
mask. She was initiated on PO Lasix 20 regimen for maintenance 
after leaving the hospital.

#L femoral neck fracture s/p ORIF
Pt presented with leg pain after slipping at home. She was found 
to have a left
subcapital femoral neck fracture seen requiring ORIF on ___ 
without any complications and minimal blood loss. She was given 
standing Tylenol for post operative pain and evaluated by 
physical therapy and orthopedic surgery throughout 
hospitalization. She was maintained on Lovenox for DVT ppx. She 
will be discharged to rehab and is being scheduled for 
Orthopedics f/u.

#UTI
On arrival, patient found to have Leuks/nitrites in UA with 
imaging findings c/w cystitis. Her urine culture grew pan 
susceptible proteus. She was not  febrile or hemodynamically 
unstable. Pt was initiated on zosyn however was able to be 
switched to Ceftriaxone and completed a three day course.

# Acute delirium on chronic Dementia
# ___ Body Dementia
Patient reported to have dementia with hallucinations at home, 
as
well as orthostatic hypotension and cogwheeling on exam. 
Clinical
picture most consistent with ___ body dementia. Patient mental
status improved with family in the room and her poor mental 
status throughout hospitalization (AOx0-1) most consistent with 
delirium in setting of advanced dementia. 

#Concern for Cholangitis:
Imaging findings on CTA chest on admission concerning for 
cholangitis.
However, patient without obstructive LFT pattern, no clear RUQ
pain and additional work up was deferred. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES  
===============  
___, resolved: Cr 1.2 from baseline 0.8 on arrival, likely 
pre-renal i/s/o
decreased PO intake from AMS. Resolved after 1L IVF

#Hx recurrent C. Diff
-Patient was given PO Vancomycin with abx for ppx, which was 
discontinued with completion of course

#Orthostatic hypotension:
-home fludrocortisone

#Thyroid nodules
TSH previously stable ___. Never on therapy. Patient 
found
to have Multinodular thyroid gland on prior CT C-spine. Largest
nodule measures 1.5 cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is
recommended. Given patient age and cognitive decline, diagnostic
thyroid US was deferred.

New Medications: Lasix 20 daily
Changed Medications: None
Held Medications: None
[ ] Consider TTE for patient if pulmonary edema recurs
[ ] Consider additional neurological work up for likely ___ 
body dementia (currently undiagnosed)
[ ] AVOID antipsychotics in patient with likely ___ body 
dementia
[ ] Ensure patient attends all post operative appointments 
[ ] D/c Lovenox ppx after 4 weeks post surgery ___ last
