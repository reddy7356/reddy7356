surgery in ___ who presented with acutely worsening lower back 
___, found to have no new fractures or concern for infection. 
Her hospital course was complicated by an episode of hypotension 
with systolic blood pressures in ___ shortly after 
administration of tizanidine.

#Bilateral hand weakness
#Left-sided burning sensation
#Low Back ___: 
Patient admitted with 5-day history of worsening back ___ that 
primarily started after receiving a steroid injection to her 
lower back approximately one month prior to presentation. 
Patient denied recent trauma or fall. She did share that she was 
previously on a higher dose of fentanyl patch at 200 mcg which 
was recently switched to a lower dose based on the patient's 
preferences around this time as well. MRI Spine obtained in ED 
showed chronic compression fracture of T12 vertebral body and 
normal spinal cord. Neurology was consulted during the patient's 
hospitalization, and recommended a repeat MRI spine to rule out 
an epidural abscess. They also recommended EMG to evaluate for 
nerve damage. Repeat MRI C/T/L spine on ___ showed no 
evidence of epidural abscess and EMG obtained on ___ 
revealed no acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or 
Guillain ___ syndrome, or generalized myopathy. Given possible 
medication side effect (see below), the patient's home dose of 
tizanidine was held prior to discharge. She was continued on her 
regularly dosed fentanyl patch. Oxycodone was increased from 10 
mg PO Q6H as needed to 15 mg Q4H as needed. Gabapentin was 
uptitrated from 300 mg TID to ___ mg TID. Her home dose of 
valium was decreased from 10 mg PO Q8H as needed to 5 mg PO Q8H 
as needed. Her other home medications were continued prior to 
discharge. 

#Hypotension: Patient had an episode of hypotension was on 
___ with SBPs in ___. Patient given narcan, 2L IVF. 
Lactate, blood cultures, urine culture were ordered and cultures 
came back negative. Etiology thought to be possibly secondary to 
opioid overdose vs. side effect from tizanidine. SBPs responded 
after administration of 2L IVF increased to 100s-110s. VBG 
notable for normal pH and no base excess. She had no recurrence 
of profound hypotension during hospitalization.

#Urinary burning: patient complained of urinary burning 
overnight on ___. UA revealed >182 WBCs though final urine 
culture from ___ showing mixed bacterial flora, consistent with 
contamination. Patient completed a 3-day course of ceftriaxone 
from ___ with resolution of symptoms. 

#Cough: Patient reported a dry cough for past three days prior 
to admission, which was stable during her hospitalization. There 
was no history of fevers and lungs sound clear anteriorly on 
exam. CXR on ___ negative for acute PNA. She was continued on 
incentive spirometer given low concern for active pulmonary 
infection during her admission. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Please have patient continue to work with Physical Therapy for 
ongoing strength and mobility training to help improve ___ and 
physical functioning 
- Patient's outpatient ___ provider is ___ 
___, ___ 
- Please consider increasing dose of gabapentin as outpatient 
(100 mg every five days as needed to achieve adequate ___ 
control without over-sedation)
- Please adjust ___ control medications (including fentanyl 
patch and oxycodone) as needed to control back ___ without 
causing sedation or hypotension
-Tizanidine discontinued from her regimen as this was thought to 
have contributed to episode of profound hypotension during 
patient's hospitalization. Would strongly encourage refraining 
from using this medication for her in the future.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___. 

Why did you come to the hospital?
 - You were admitted to the hospital for worsening back ___. 

What did you receive in the hospital?
 - You underwent an MRI of your spine, which showed no lesions 
or signs of infection of your spinal cord. The MRI did show a 
compression fracture of your thoracic spinal column, which was 
stable in appearance when compared to previous studies. You 
actually had a repeat MRI to look for any spinal infection, and 
this was also negative. 
- During your hospitalization, you had an episode of low blood 
pressure which was thought to be due to medication side effect. 
We decreased your dose of valium, increased your dose of 
oxycodone and gabapentin, and decided to stop your home dose of 
tizanidine out of concern that this may have contributed to the 
episode of low blood pressures. 
- We additionally treated you with a 3-day course of antibiotics 
for a urinary tract infection. 

What should you do once you leave the hospital?
 - Continue to work with Physical Therapy for strength and 
mobility exercises and continue to follow up with your 
outpatient ___ medicine physician for ongoing ___ management 
and care. 
- If you have fevers, chills, confusion, or lightheadedness, 
please seek medical care.
- We want to emphasize that we are very concerned that the 
tizanidine was the cause of your low blood pressures. We 
strongly encourage you to not take this medication again.

We wish you the best!
Your ___ Care Team

Chief Complaint:
back pain, syncope
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
___ woman with a history of low back pain presented to
the ED with worsening low back pain. She was also reporting
syncopal events and was noted to be bradycardic on outside
hospital records so admitted to medicine for further management. 


In the ED, initial VS were:  98.1 78 166/67 18 98%RA. She was
given 60mg of oxycodone and 10mg of diazepam. Per ED dash, OSH
records (which did not come up with patient from the ED) she had
a "recent" MRI of her spine which showed stability of her known,
old T12 compression fracture. Also, per reports, she had
documented episodes of bradycardia.    

On arrival to the floor, she reports having a procedure (?nerve
block, she is not entirely sure) for pain earlier on ___. At that time, her fentanyl patch was taken off and she was
switched to 10mg of valium TID and 30mg of oxycodone q8h (pt 
says
more frequent but rx is written q8h). Since this procedure, she
notes worsening back pain at the site of her previous lumbar
fracture. The pain is so bad that it is difficult for her to
breath. She hasn't been able to really walk too well for the 
past
four weeks. She otherwise ambulates independently. She has also
had twitching since the procedure. She also has been 
syncopizing.
These syncopal events are preceded by a feeling of warmth and
neck pressure. She did hit her head during one recent event.

Telemetry: SVT to 150 seen which was limited to ___ minutes and 
resolved spontaneously. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
#Syncope: Pt's history unclear vasovagal vs primary cardiac 
etiology. In speaking with her pain management center, when she 
runs out of narcotics, she has multiple somatic complaints which 
she was told to report to the hospital for.  Cardiology was 
consulted on the patient and did not think that her story was 
convincing for cardiogenic syncope.  She had a ___ minute 
episode of SVT to 150 on the monitor that was unprovoked and 
asymptomatic.  She ruled-out for MI.  Cardiology ordered an 
echocardiogram, but the results were pending at the time of this 
dictation.  She was given Metoprolol 25mg PO daily.  She 
described episodes where her face becomes red and swells then 
she passes out, but these were not observed.  

#Opiate use disorder with drug seeking behavior - The patient 
has a challenging past with narcotics.  I spoke to her 
outpatient pain clinic who has recently discharged her recently 
for consistently misusing and overusing medications.  ___ RN 
there who knows the patient well states that the patient's 
daughter was murdered in the ___, and each recurring winter, 
she has had uncontrolled back pain, requests large doses of 
narcotics, and misuses them.  The patient would call multiple 
times a day, and if the call was not answered immediately, she 
would leave messages over 7 minutes long.  The patient states 
that she is supposed to be on long-acting narcotics, and that 
multiple other doctors have ___ this.  This is unsubstantiated 
with my review of her records.  She also states that other 
doctors here told ___ she needed to be on more opioids, which is 
also untrue.  Much of the information I relayed to her she 
disputed and said that she has recordings of conversations from 
the pain clinic that she will use to rebut certain statements.  
Her outpatient providers say that she does record conversations 
and threatens to sue when she does not receive certain doses of 
narcotics.  On admission, her medications were unclear, so the 
original provider placed her on Fentanyl 75mcg which was reduced 
to 50 mcg in ___ days after admission.  She was also placed on 
Oxycodone 15mg PO q4 PRN (pain management program said that she 
used up her one month supply in less than 2 weeks).  This was 
discontinued when her history was elicited from outpatient 
providers. 

I also spoke to her primary care provider's office RN who 
described challenges with opiate misuse and also more than one 
episode where she required Narcan for opiate overdose.   I 
explained to the PCP's office that I thought providing 
controlled substances to this patient was very risky and 
potential danger, so therefore, I would not be giving her any of 
these.  They also stated that her PCP was out of town, but that 
the back-up provider would also not provide any additional 
narcotics. She has follow-up in early ___. She was on Valium 
10mg TID on admission, which was weaned down to 5 TID given 
somnolence, and this was tapered to off.  Although I do not 
think she will undergo any withdrawal, I provided her for 
Dicyclomine, Zofran, and Imodium in case she has any symptoms of 
withdrawal.  She was referred to psychiatry on multiple 
occasions, both as inpatient and as outpatient and has refused 
this intervention consistently.  She was given information for 
Suboxone and Methadone programs as an outpatient, but she stated 
that she did not want to have to talk to anyone, she just wanted 
to get the drugs.  We tried to persuade her that this form of 
treatment would be in here interest, but she had reasons that 
she did not want to do this.  Her son called asking why she was 
not going to be given narcotic prescriptions.  I explained that 
this is not different from her outpatient provider's decisions, 
and if he disagrees, he is welcome to reach out to them or 
pursue a second opinion at a different institution.  

#Disposition - she was recommended to be discharged to rehab, 
but refused.  She was then recommended to have home with 
services, which are being set-up, though she also expressed 
refusal of these too.

Dear Ms. ___,

We admitted you for problems with your chronic pain and feelings 
of "passing out." While you were here, we watched your heart 
rhythm which was fast up to 150.  In addition, you have new

Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
back pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Removal of hardware, T11, T12, L1.
2. Exploration of spinal fusion, T11-12, T12-L1.

 
History of Present Illness:
___ female who was treated her in ___ when she 
presented with an unstable thoracic spine injury/Chance fracture 
at T12. This required urgent surgical treatment, which is a 
decompression and fusion with instrumentation from T12 through 
L1. Postoperatively, she maintained her neurological function, 
with no residual spinal cord symptoms, and also healed her 
fractures ultimately. She presents now because she has 
considerable back pain, tenderness, with prominence of the 
stabilizing implants. Dr. ___ provide her with 
injections that provided short-term relief around the hardware, 
and also provocative tests to demonstrate that the hardware has
significantly contribueted to her pain. Ms. ___ also has a 
long history of difficulty with narcotics, and also significant 
psychosocial life stressors that are likely contributing to her 
pain. This has been longer recognized by her psychiatrist in 
conjunction with us in the past. Before she was injured years 
ago, her husband died. More recently, her daughter has also 
died. By report from the patient, her daughter was actually 
murdered. This is contributing significantly to her psychosocial 
stressors, and I suspect this is significant component of her 
pain experienced. Regardless, she certainly has severe 
significant tenderness over the hardware, which is palpable 
bilaterally. They also seem to be prominent on the CT scan. The 
CT scan is very helpful and showing that the fracture is healed, 
fusion has mended, and there is no lucency around the hardware 
to indicate migration or fatigue. She presents now for removal 
of hardware
