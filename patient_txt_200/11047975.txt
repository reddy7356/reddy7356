History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with DM and CAD s/p CABG who presented to an 
OSH on ___ with CP. He lives in ___ and was visiting family 
for ___. He has chronic angina with baseline tolerance of 
approximately 2 flights of stairs. He says he has had multiple 
admissions for CHF exacerbations this year.
.
Over the week preceding his admission, he noticed that his chest 
pain was occuring at lower levels of exertion, and was also 
occuring at rest. The discomfort felt like a pressure sensation, 
similar to past angina. It was substernal in location without 
radiation. Symptoms were accompanied by dyspnea. He was woken up 
from sleep with the chest discomfort the morning of admission, 
with accompanying cough and diaphoresis. At that point, he 
decided to seek evaluation at the OSH ED.
.
Of note, in the two weeks preceding his presentation he had 
developed increased lower extremity edema and 15lb weight gain. 
He denied PND but did have ___ pillow orthopnea. Had been told 
by his PCP ~2 weeks PTA to discontinue lasix. Says he has been 
otherwise compliant with his medications and salt restriction. 
Of note, he had chronic nose bleeds ___ years, denies other 
bleeding problems including melena or hematochezia. No fevers, 
chills, sweats, change in bowel habits, or h/o thrombosis.
.
At the OSH, on admission to the ICU, vitals were T 97.7 P 92 BP 
119/74 RR 20 O2 96% on 2L. His labs were notable for WBC 12, 
Hb/Hct ___, Plts 216k, Cr 1.1, Tropn 0.04, CK 66, and BNP of 
598. Stool was guiac negative. CXR reportedly was c/w mild 
pulmonary edema. EKG at admission was significant for diffuse 
TWI and ST depression in anterolateral leads. He was treated 
with IV lasix and placed on a nitroglycerin drip, and was 
transfused total of 4 units PRBCs. His troponin and CK reached 
peaks of 13 and 349 respectively on ___.
.  
The patient was transferred to ___ on ___ for planned cardiac 
catheterization on ___.
.

.
ETT MIBI (___): The patient exercised for 7 minutes on a 
modified ___ protocol and stopped for progressive shortness of 
breath 
and fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 4.9 which 
represents a 
poor exercise tolerance for his age. The patient denied any arm, 
neck, 
back, or chest discomfort throughout the procedure. In the 
setting of 
RBBB, the ST-T wave changes noted anteriorally are 
uninterpretable for 
ischemia. During exercise, nonspecific T wave normalization was 
noted 
inferiorally. No additional ST-T wave changes were noted in the 
lateral 
precordial leads during the procedure. The rhythm was sinus with 
rare 
isolated VPBs. The hemodynamic response to exercise was 
appropriate. IMPRESSION: Limited functional exercise tolerance. 
No anginal type 
symptoms. Anterior ST-T wave changes are uninterpretable in the 
presence 
of the RBBB. Non-specific T wave normalization noted 
inferiorally. 1.  Normal myocardial perfusion. 2.  Mild global 
hypokinesis is consistent with cardiomyopathy, perhaps from 
multi-vessel disease. Septal dyskinesis is likely post-surgical. 
 EF=48%.
.
Cardiac cath (___): Severe native vessel disease with 
patent stents.
.
TTE (___):
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately 
dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-50 
%) secondary to hypokinesis of the inferior septum, inferior 
free wall, and posterior wall. There is no ventricular septal 
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline 
normal free wall function. The aortic root is moderately dilated 
at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are 
focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. NSTEMI, coronary artery disease
Mr. ___ ruled in for a NSTEMI at the outside hospital and had 
been started on a heparin drip prior to transfer, but did not 
receive a GPIIbIIIa antagonist. Here, his cardiac enzymes 
continued to trend down and he had no further episodes of chest 
pain or shortness of breath. Given his significant epistaxis 
with Hct of 24 at admission, demand ischemia was an important 
consideration. The patient went to exercise stress test with 
perfusion imaging to help assess whether his chest pain 
represented severe demand ischemia in the setting of recent 
blood loss vs. an ACS event that resolved. Stress testing 
revealed depressed exercise capacity without conclusive EKG 
changes and no perfusion defects. Despite the negative stress 
test, the team was concerned about the possibility of in-stent 
restenosis so the patient was taken to cardiac catheterization. 
Cardiac cath revealed severe native vessel disease with patent 
stents. No intervention was undertaken, and the plan was to 
intensify medical management. He will continue aspirin, plavix, 
metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and isosorbide mononitrate 
as an outpatient. The patient's lipids were under excellent 
control and A1c returned at 7.3, showing only fair diabetes 
control. The patient was given clear instructions to call and 
follow-up with his primary cardiologist and primary care 
physician in ___ next week.

2. CHF, acute on chronic, systolic
The patient's symptoms of weight gain and lower extremity edema 
were concerning for exacerbation of his known CHF. Upon 
transfer, he did have evidence of pulmonary edema on exam and on 
his chest film and was therefore diuresed with lasix. An 
echocardiogram was repeated which showed depressed systolic 
function with EF 40-50% and hypokinesis of the 
inferior/posterior LV. He will continue his beta blocker and 
ACEI and follow up with his outpatient cardiologist. At 
discharge, he was breathing comfortably on ambient air and 
ambulating independently. However as he did still appear to be 
somewhat volume overloaded, he was discharged on PO lasix, which 
he will continue as an outpatient. He was instructed to weigh 
himself daily. He will need further titration of his diuretic 
regimen as an outpatient. 

3. Anemia with acute blood loss, history of epistaxis
The patient had no significant gross bleeding in hospital, but 
did report recent epistaxis. He had been transfused with 4units 
PRBCs prior to transfer, but did not require additional 
transfusions at this admission. He apparently has required 
cautery by ENT as an outpatient. Workup of his anemia showed 
evidence of iron deficiency and also B12 deficiency, so he was 
started on both iron supplements and B12 supplementation. He 
will need to follow up with ENT and his PCP as an outpatient.

4. Heme positive stools
The patient's stools were noted to be hemoccult positive, 
possibly due to swallowed blood from his epistaxis. He did have 
history of gastritis at endoscopy in past per outside records. 
He will need to followup with his PCP for consideration of 
repeat EGD and colonoscopy to rule out other sources of GI 
bleeding.

5. Hypothyroidism
The patient was continued on his home dose of levothyroxine. His 
TSH was mildly elevated when checked here. He should have a 
thyroid function panel rechecked as an outpatient.

6. Diabetes
The patient's oral agents were held in hospital, and he was 
convered with insulin sliding scale. His HbA1c was 7.3 showing 
only fair glucose control. He should followup with his PCP for 
further adjustment to his diabetes medications.

7. Transient Heart block
On the morning of discharge, the patient had 2 dropped beats 
(consistent with Mobitz II block) without clinical sequelae 
occurring at 2AM with sleep on telemetry. This was felt likely 
secondary to high vagal tone +/- a complication of OSA. The 
patient had no other similar findings on telemetry throughout 
his hospitalization. Per discussion with EP, no further 
inpatient workup was required and he should followup with his 
cardiologist.

8. Diarrhea
The patient developed some loose stools prior to discharge, but 
abdomen was benign without fever or leukocytosis. Stool was sent 
for C. diff toxin x1, returned negative. Patient advised not to 
take anti-motility agents at home and to return should his 
diarrhea worsen, or if he were to develop abdominal pains or 
fevers. He understood this plan.

Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred to ___ for further 
evaluation of your heart disease. At the other hospital, you had 
blood tests that showed evidence of a heart attack. This was 
treated with medicines. You underwent a stress test that showed 
no new areas of the heart with poor function. You also had a 
cardiac catheterization which showed narrowing of the coronary 
vessels, but your prior cardiac stents and grafts from the CABG 
surgery were open. You did not have any additional stents placed 
here. 
.
Your heart medicines were adjusted here, but you will need 
close, regular follow up with your home cardiologists for 
further management of your heart disease. You should also follow 
up with your ear,nose,throat specialist for further management 
of your nose bleeds. You did have evidence of blood in your 
stools by chemical testing. This may be due to swallowed blood 
from nosebleeds, but you  should follow up with your primary 
care doctor in the next month for further evaluation and 
possible repeat endoscopy studies. You were also to have low

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. ___ is a ___ man with recurrence of HCC 
(cycle ___ ___, CAD s/p 3v-CABG with PCI and DES, CHF 
(LVEF 40%), DM2, and HTN who presents to the ED with confusion 
and syncope.  On the morning of admission, he was attempting to 
get out of bed, but said he lost his footing and fell, 
fortunately without any acute injury, but felt very disoriented 
afterwards.  His fall was unwitnessed, and he has difficulty 
articulating the events preceding and during the fall.  He is 
unsure if he lost consciousness, but did remember feeling very 
weak and confused afterwards. His sister, with whom he lives, 
reports she first noticed his altered state when he exhibited 
strange perseverative behavior, looking through papers to find a 
phone number, but would repeatedly lose his train of thought 
midway.  No chest pain, shortness of breath, or prodromal 
symptoms such as feeling warm, N/V, diaphoresis, or 
lightheadedness prior to the fall.  He recalled that he ate a 
late lunch and thus skipped dinner, but took his evening insulin 
dose.  He did not check his FSBG in the morning.  He reports 
that he had been hydrating well, but may not have been enough.  
He was scheduled for cycle ___ ___ treatment for 
recurrence of his focal HCC this morning, but due to his acutely 
altered mental status s/p fall, was referred to the ED for 
further evaluation. 

In the ED, his intial vitals were: 98.5 71 116/60 16 97%RA.  
Labs were notable for FSBG 400s, anemia with HCT 28.1, 
thrombocytopenia with platelet of 132, hyponatremia to 129, 
creatinine of 1.1, AST of 61, ALP of 431 with normal synthetic 
liver function (INR of 1.2 and T. Bili of 0.7), normal UA except 
glycosuria and troponin < 0.01. CT head was normal.  CXR was 
normal.  ECG was unchanged from prior.  He was given insulin for 
hyperglycemia with good response.  He had a asymptomatic 10-beat 
run wide-complex tachycardia which was either NSVT or artifact 
(he was shifting during the event). He was subsequently admitted 
to medicine for further evaluation and management.

On the floor, he continued to endorse weakness and fatigue, but 
no CP/SOB/LH/N/V, no fevers or chills.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with recurrence of HCC (cycle 
___ ___, CAD s/p 3v-CABG with PCI and DES, CHF (LVEF 
40%), DM2, and HTN who presents to the ED with confusion s/p an 
unwitnessed fall, appears to be syncopal with inability to 
recall details of the fall. 

# Syncope: s/p unwitnessed fall, altered sensorium after fall, 
no injuries. Appears to have been a sudden fall, likely with 
loss of consciousness, as patient had no recollection of events 
of fall, except disorientation after the fall.  Syncope may be 
attributable to cardiac syncope, given his significant cardiac 
clinical history, or orthostasis, as patient was being 
aggressively diuresed with lasix with concomitant decreased 
po/fluid intake with recent ___ treatments. On admission, 
he was afebrile, SBP 110's, and his labs were notable for FSBG 
400s, anemia with hct 28.1, plt 132, he was slightly pre-renal 
with Cr of 1.1, transaminitis of AST of 61, elevated ALP of 431, 
and glycosuria. Negative cardiac enzymes x 2, EKG unchanged from 
prior. CT head was normal. CXR was normal. He was given insulin 
for hyperglycemia with good response. He had two asymptomatic 
runs of ___ NSVT. Etiology unclear, but cardiac syncope is 
possible given his clinical history of CAD s/p 3v-CABG, CHF with 
low LVEF, prior NSTEMI, intermittent palpitations, and recurrent 
runs of non-sustained VT since admission.  Unstable 
angina/NSTEMI unlikely, given absence of ischemia on EKG and 
normal initial troponins.  Patient reports never having had any 
heart murmurs, but on exam, a ___ systolic ejection murmur could 
be auscultated, loudest at the R ___ ICS. Unclear if this is 
new. Patient denies knowledge of any heart murmurs, such as 
aortic stenosis.  He had an NSTEMI in ___, and prior 
cardiac echos in ___ and ___ revealed changes in systolic 
CHF with LVEF 60%->35%, and development of valvular dysfunction, 
including aortic sclerosis.  We continued to monitor him on 
telemetry, without significant arrhythmias detected. 
Differential also included orthostatic hypotension, as his BP 
was low, he had positive orthostatic vital signs, he was 
pre-renal, and he had reported feeling dehydrated on the evening 
of his fall.  He improved on IV fluids and we adjusted his 
insulin regimen, but feel that his current home insulin regimen 
may need to be reduced as his po intake has decreased over the 
past month, likely due to the recurrence of his HCC and 
___ treatments. He has follow-up with cardiology and 
endocrinology as an outpatient following discharge.    

# DM2: Hyperglycemic with significant glucosuria on admission as 
well as the following morning, so we resumed his home evening 
lantus at a reduced dose of 60U (home is 70U).  On his home dose 
of bedtime lantus, he became hypoglycemic with BS 59 in the 
morning.  We held his home glimepride, continue lantus but at 50 
units QHS and humalog insulin sliding scale.  We recommend 
adjusting his home lantus and HISS, as it may be too aggressive 
for his current degree of po intake.  Plan for follow-up with 
outpatient endocrinologist.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___.  As you know, you were admitted after having confusion 
following a fall at home.  You were admitted with blood sugars 
of 434 and confusion.  We adjusted your insulin regimen, gave 
you fluids, and your confusion improved.  We recommend that you 
see your endocrinologist (see below) for further adjustments in 
your insulin.  We performed a head CT scan and chest x-ray which 
were both reassuring.  We also monitored your heart activity 
with an EKG throughout your hospitalization.  You developed a 
few episodes of abnormal rhythms of a few beats during your 
hospitalization, and we spoke with your cardiologist. We 
recommend that you follow-up with her following your 
hospitalization (as below) as well.  

Please see the attached list for changes to your medications.
The only medication change is to stop your glimepazide, decrease 
your lantus dose to 50 Units and adjusted insulin sliding scale.

Additionally, please continue to weigh yourself as you are doing 
every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

It was a pleasure caring for you,
Your ___ Doctors
