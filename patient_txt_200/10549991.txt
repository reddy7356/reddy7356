Discharge Instructions:
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOWING BELOW OR ABOVE KNEE AMPUTATION

This information is designed as a guideline to assist you in a 
speedy recovery from your surgery. Please follow these 
guidelines unless your physician has specifically instructed you 
otherwise. Please call our office nurse if you have any 
questions. Dial 911 if you have any medical emergency.

ACTIVITY: There are restrictions on activity. On the side of 
your amputation you are only to bear weight on your heels until 
cleared by your Surgeon. You should keep this amputation site 
elevated when ever possible.

Try not to exert to much pressure on the amputation site when 
transferring and or pivoting. 

No driving until cleared by your Surgeon or while taking pain 
medications. 

PLEASE CALL US IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS:

Redness in or drainage from your leg wound(s)

Watch for signs and symptoms of infection. These are: a fever 
greater than 101 degrees, chills, increased redness, or pus 
draining from the incision site. If you experience any of these 
or bleeding at the incision site, CALL THE DOCTOR.

Exercise: Limit strenuous activity for 6 weeks. Do not drive a 
car unless cleared by your Surgeon.

Try to keep leg elevated when able.

BATHING/SHOWERING: You may shower immediately upon coming home. 
No bathing. Adressing may cover youâ€™re amputation site and this 
should be left in place for three (3) days. Remove it after this 
time and wash your incision(s) gently with soap and water. You 
will have sutures, which are usually removed in 4 weeks. This 
will be done by the Surgeon on your follow-up appointment.

WOUND CARE: Sutures / Staples may be removed before discharge. 
If they are not, an appointment will be made for you to return 
for staple
removal.

When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place 
pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.

Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for 
four weeks after surgery.

MEDICATIONS: Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all 
of the medications you were taking before surgery. You will be 
given a new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken 
every three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary.

Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you 
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check 
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel 
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may 
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite 
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small 
balanced meals throughout the day.

CAUTIONS: NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it 
really is an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes 
narrowing of your blood vessels which in turn decreases 
circulation. If you smoke you will need to stop as soon as 
possible. Ask your nurse or doctor for information on smoking 
cessation.

Avoid pressure to your amputation site. No strenuous activity 
for 6 weeks after surgery.

DIET : There are no special restrictions on your diet 
postoperatively. Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and 
small, frequent meals may be preferred.

For people with vascular problems we would recommend a 
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and 
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile 
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in 
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a 
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that 
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to 
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the 
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density 
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's 
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred 
or get a referral from your doctor.

If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight 
anagement program. Your health and its improvement depend on it. 
We now that making changes in your lifestyle will not be easy, 
and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new 
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get 
a referral from your doctor.

Dear Mr. ___,
 
You were admitted to the Vascular Surgery service after your 
left ___ toe amputation. Your procedure went well without 
complications and you are recovering well. At this time, you are 
eating normally, able to use the restroom without difficulty and 
have been restarted on all of your home medications. You are now 
ready to continue your recovery at home, with the following 
instructions.

ACTIVITY:
â€¢ On the side of your amputation you are non-weight bearing on 
the front of your foot.  You should only be bearing weight on 
the heel of your foot, so please use your orthotics.
â€¢ You should keep this amputation site elevated whenever 
possible
â€¢ You may use the opposite foot for transfers and pivots
â€¢ No driving until cleared by your surgeon
â€¢ No heavy lifting greater than 20 pounds for the next 3 weeks
 
BATHING/SHOWERING:

staple removal.
â€¢ When the sutures are removed the doctor may or may not place

IMAGING/STUDIES
===============
___ L Foot XRay: 
Status post trans phalangeal amputations of the first through 
fifth toes.  No definite erosion to suggest osteomyelitis.

___ Arterial Study: 
Evidence of moderate to severe ischemia bilateral lower 
extremities, worse on the left.

___ Ultrasound Vein Mapping:
The great saphenous veins have been harvested bilaterally. The 
small saphenous veins are patent and with diameters as above. 
Please see digitized image on PACS for formal sequential 
measurements.

___ MRI:
Soft tissue edema along the lateral fifth proximal phalanx, with 
adjacent bone marrow edema, hypointense T1 bone marrow signal 
and enhancement of the fifth proximal phalanx and metatarsal 
head.  No cortical irregularity, erosion or soft tissue sinus 
tract extending to bone is seen.  No significant fifth MTP joint 
effusion.  Marrow edema is relatively intense, but the 
differential diagnosis includes prominent reactive marrow edema 
versus osteomyelitis of the fifth metatarsal head and proximal 
fifth phalanx.  No localized fluid collection or abscess. 
Relatively large soft tissue hemangioma in the plantar soft 
tissues of the forefoot, detailed above.  This corresponds to 
phleboliths seen on the ___ radiographs.

___ L Foot XRay: 
Status post resection of distal fifth metatarsal with expected 
postoperative findings. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is ___ M with PMH type I diabetes, CVA, PVD who 
presents as a direct admit for infected L foot ulcer. He 
underwent an angiogram and stent placement to increase blood 
flow to the LLE. An MRI was concerning for osteomyelitis, so the 
patient was taken to the OR by podiatry for wound debridement 
and bone excision. He was continued on IV vancomycin and PO 
ciprofloxacin. The treatment course will depend on the bone 
pathology results.

#Infected L foot ulcer: 
#Osteomyelitis:
The patient presented with an infected left foot in the setting 
of three months of increasing pain. Xray with possible 
osteomyelitis. Vascular angiogram performed on ___ and stent 
was placed to improve vascular flow in the left lower extremity. 
The angiogram showed poor perfusion in the L lower extremity. 
MRI with evidence of osteomyelitis. The patient was started on 
IV vanc/flagyl/cipro ___ which were then stopped in an 
attempt to have the patient off of antibiotics for 48 hours to 
get culture data when patient went to the OR for debridement. 
The podiatry team performed a debridement in the OR on ___. 
Unfortunately, no intra-op cultures were sent, and the specimen 
was only sent for pathology. Per ID, the plan was to empirically 
continue treating for osteomyelitis for a 6 week course. If bone 
pathology demonstrates clear margins, treatment will stop after 
2 weeks of IV therapy. Day 1 = ___. Patient should follow-up 
with ___ OPAT, Podiatry, and vascular surgery. 

# ___: Patient had a Cr of 1.3 (baseline 1.0). Resolved with 
IVF. Likely prerenal in the setting of being NPO for procedure. 
Lisinopril and HCTZ held given ___ and ___ in the 
hospital.

#Peripheral vascular disease: The patient was evaluated by the 
vascular team and a stent was placed as above. He was continued 
on home aspirin and Plavix. 

#T1DM complicated by diabetic neuropathy: Patient was diagnosed 
with T1DM at age ___. Home regimen is 36U of Lantus at bedtime, 
Humalog 5U, 2U, 4U with breakfast, lunch, dinner respectively. 
His blood sugars were difficult to control when he was NPO for 
procedures. Please continue to monitor blood sugars closely.
