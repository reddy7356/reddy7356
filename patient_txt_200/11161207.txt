Chief Complaint:
Increasing frequency of seizures
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
video EEG

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms ___ is a ___ year old right handed woman with a
history of primary generalized epilepsy who is presenting with
increase in seizure frequency.   At age ___ she was experiencing 
a
myoclonic jerking in the early morning hours.  A year later when
she was ___ years old she continued to have more frequent 
jerking.
At ___ years of age she had similar jerking of her extremities in
the morning followed by a generalized seizure and postictal
phase.  At that time, she was working in the ___ with her
hands jerking more than usual that morning.  She was given a
diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy; however, there does 
not
seem to be episodes of absence seizures that she reports.  She
started on Depakote.  However, when she was pregnant with her
son, she was weaned off her medications and soon after delivery
she had another seizure and was restarted back on medication. 
Her seizures were controlled on the Depakote for sometime until
recently.   She describes having a generalized convulsion every 
1
to ___ years.   In ___ she had a generalized seizure
while she was sitting in a car.  After this she was started on
Lamictal along with the Depakote.  On ___ she had 
a
generalized seizure, she fell back and hit her head badly during
the seizure. During the seizure she had some trouble speaking 
and
her words were getting out backwards.  She then began having
atypical episodes which lead to her lamictal being uptitrated. 
She had another generalized seizure in ___ which resulted in a
severe car accident for which she went to ___ rehab.  
While in rehab they began weaning her off of the depakote and
onto Lamictal monotherapy.   This decision was based mostly on
the long term side effects of depakote and weight gain with her
already difficulties with obstructive sleep apnea.   She had
another seizure during this transition but it was unclear what
does she was on at that time.   

Nonetheless she continued to have an increase in not only
generalized seizures but since being on lamictal monotherapy
began to develop "auras."  She describes these auras as episodes
of extreme exhaustion, a 'rush through her whole body'  If she
did not take ativan when these auras occur she would begin to
have rhythmic jerking movements of her hands followed by a
generalized seizure.   Because of this increase in frequency she
was admitted to the Epilepsy service at ___ from ___ to
___.  During this admission she reportedly had one
generalized tonic-clonic seizure, although it was unclear if 
this
was captured on EEG as telemetry did not reveal any  seizures.  
Nonetheless she had multiple push buttons for twitching,
spaciness, fatigue, all of which generally correlated with brief
generalized spike/wave and polyspike discharges.   She was
initiated on clobazam and was titrated up to 10 mg BID and
discharged home.  

Since that admission she has continued to decline with frequent
auras and generalized seizures.  She has continued to be 
titrated
up on the clobazam up to ___ and remains on lamictal 475 mg
BID.  

Her current frequency is about 2 per month of the generalized
tonic clonic seizures lasting about 1 minute and 1 per week of
the aura.  She also describes worsening of her gait and
cognition.  She can no longer walk supportive and is very
emotional.  She states she has had frequent visits with her
therapist, however she is depressed and anxious because she is
living in constant fear that she is going to have another
seizure.  
She also has sleep apnea, does not use a C-PAP mask and has
previously not noted sleep apnea as
a trigger for her seizures.

since ___ years of age, diagnosed with likely JME and now with
generalized epilepsy and major depression, who presents as an
elective admission for EEG characterization of increasing events
concerning for seizures. 

The events in question are episodes of extreme exhaustion, a
"rush through my body, like the sensation of a volcano that's
about to explode", tremors of her arms and face bilaterally, and
sudden crying. These started three months ago, and having been
happening once per month since then. If she does not take ativan

movements of her hands followed by a generalized seizure. Her
last event was in late ___. After this her lamictal XR was

lot worse since then. 

Her seizure triggers are sleep deprivation, stress and missed
medications. She endorses chronically poor sleep, partly due to
sleep apnea (for which she is scheduled to be fitting for CPAP 
in
the near future). Sleep has been even worse lately due to stress
over her son's upcoming wedding and depression related to her
worsening memory issues.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team 
following a motor vehicle accident.  The Orthopaedic Trauma 
service was consulted for repair of the right radius and left 
tibial plateau fractures, and on ___ the patient was taken to 
the Operating Room for open reduction and internal fixation of 
the right radius as well as external fixation of the left tibia. 
 Please see Operative Report for full details.  The patient 
tolerated the procedure well, and there were no complications.  
She received perioperative antibiotics as well as Lovenox for 
DVT prophylaxis.  Postoperatively, the patient was transfused 2 
units of pRBCs for acute blood loss anemia.  On ___, the 
patient returned to ___ Operating Room for removal of the 
external fixator and open reduction and internal fixation of the 
left tibia.  Again, the patient tolerated the procedure well.  
Post-operatively, she was transferred to the Orthopaedic Surgery 
service for further care.   

The Neurology service was consulted during this hospitalization 
given the patient's seizure history. Continuous EEG monitoring 
was performed, with no clear seizure events identified.  Her 
home anti-seizure medications were continued and her Depakote 
levels were followed.  She should continue to have daily 
Depakote levels drawn at the rehab facility.

The patient worked with both the Physical and Occupational 
Therapy services during her hospitalization and made steady 
progress.

On ___, the patient fell from a seated position on the side 
of her bed.  The fall was witnessed, and there was no headstrike 
or loss of consciousness.  X-rays of the left leg and right arm 
were performed to ensure that there was no hardware complication 
or new fracture.

The patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition with 
detailed precautionary instructions as well as instructions 
regarding follow-up.  She was able to void spontaneously, with 
pain controlled by oral pain medications.  She expressed 
readiness for discharge to a rehab facility.  She was discharged 
to rehab in stable condition.
