ACTIVE ISSUES:
===============================
# Fever:  As per patient, did receive influenza vaccine and 
rapid flu test was negative which makes an influenza diagnosis 
unlikely. CXR was performed in the ED that showed pulmonary 
fibrosis and bronchiectasis similar to previous but superimposed 
infection could not be excluded. With the patient receiving 
methotrexate weekly for her RA, she is immunosuprressed. Blood 
culture ___ bottle) from ___ grew micrococcus/stomatoccus 
species which is most likely a contaminant.
Patient initially started on vancomycin on ___ but 
discontinued on ___ after blood culture speciated. UA on 
admission was positive for leuks and 29 WBC but urine culture 
was contaminated, repeat UA on ___ also with posiive leuks and 
17 WBC but urine culture was with no growth and patient without 
any UTI symptoms throughout hospitalization. Stated that her 
chronic joint pain and swelling was at baseline. Clinically, 
patient improved and had no further fevers. Her fever on 
admission is most likely secondary to a viral syndrome that has 
now resolved. At discharge, she was feeling well with stable 
vital signs.    

# back rash: began on ___ and very pruritic. Appears 
macular-papular and extending to her buttocks. Likely secondary 
to heat rash as patient mostly laying on back throughout the day 
with significant perspiration. Sarna lotion was applied with 
good relief. Will need to keep area cooled and dried, and thus 
will likely improve once ambulation improves with ___ at rehab.  

# stage II sacral ulcer and R medial malleolus ulcer: appears 
stable without signs of active infection. Daily wound care 
provided. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
==============================
# a.fib: As per OMR the patient is not anticoagulated as per 
cardiologists request. She was rate controlled with metoprolol.

# Neck pain/DJD: She was continued on fentanyl patch, vicodin 
was replaced with oxycodone and tylenol PRN while admitted. 
Patient did not request oxycodone/tylenol and pain appeared to 
be well controlled on just the fentanyl patch. Discharged with 
instructions to only continue the fentanyl patch for pain. 

# RA c/b pulmonary fibrosis: patient weaned off O2 and satting 
well on RA. Her methotrexate was not given on ___. She will need 
to restart her weekly methotrexate on ___.

# HTN: She was continued on home captopril.

# HLD: She was continued on home atorvastatin and aspirin

# h/o CVA: She was continued on aspirin 81mg.

# Hypothyroidism: She was continued on her home levothyroxine. 
TSH was 1.7

# GERD: Since esomeprazole was nonformulary, she was 
administered omeprazole while in house. Her esomeprazole was 
continued on discharge.

# Depression: She was continued on her home citalopram.

# Glaucoma: She was continued on her home brimonidine drops.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
===============================
-patient did not receive her weekly MTX on ___, please resume 
MTX on ___
-please ensure back rash is improving
-while hospitalized patient's pain was well controlled with only 
fentanyl patch, she was instructed to discontinue vicodin. 
Please reassess pain and adjust pain medications as appropriate
-please f/u with pending blood cultures

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay at ___ 
___. You were admitted to the 
hospital because you were having fevers and felt generally weak 
at home. While here in the hospital, we determined that you did 
NOT have the flu. We also looked for other types of infections. 
A Chest Xray did not show pneumonia. Your urine did not show any 
infection. Your blood grew small amount of a bacteria but it is 
most likely a contaminant.

You had a rash on your back which improved with ambulation. 
Please make sure you keep your back dried and prevent sweating 
around that area. Use sarna lotion as needed for itchiness. We 
recommend that you use sheets without bleach or dyes in case 
this was contributing.

You improved clinically even after we discontinued your 
antibiotics, which means that you likely had a viral infection 
that cleared. You will need to go to reab to help improve your 
strength. 

Please make sure you follow up with your primary care physician 
and your ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of RA, pulmonary fibrosis, HTN, HLD, CAD, CVA, 
recent admission from ___ for ___ who presents with 
worsening dyspnea, transferred to CCU for atrial fibrillation 
with hypotension, later made comfort care and expired after 
worsening respiratory condition.
.
Active issues:
# Interstitial lung disease 
Patient initially admitted with concern for pneumonia in setting 
of underlying interstitial fibrosis thought to be secondary to 
rheumatoid arthritis. Patient was treated empirically for HCAP, 
atypical, and aspiration pneumonias, diuresed given concern for 
pulmonary edema in setting of fluid resuscitation for afib with 
RVR, and was started on methylprednisolone for possibly flare of 
underlying interstitial lung disease by Pulmonary 
recommendation. There was no indication of other atypical 
infections including fungus or PCP. Despite therapies, patient's 
respiratory status worsened, thought to represent worsening of 
her chronic fibrosis. After multiple family meetings with the 
patient and her family, and input from PCP and primary 
pulmonologist, she was made comfortable and patient expired 
without invasive interventions.
.
# Afib with RVR 
Patient with history of atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated, 
with calculated CHADS2 score of 4. Per primary cardiologist, 
patient was high fall risk. During her stay, she had multiple 
episodes of afib with RVR requiring diltiazem gtt and IV fluid 
boluses.

___ CXR:
1. New left basilar opacity on the AP view without definite 
correlate on the lateral view, may reflect soft tissue 
attenuation, though if there is ongoing clinical concern for 
pneumonia, repeat PA and lateral radiographs could be obtained.
2. New subtle nodular density projecting over the right midlung, 
which should be further evaluated with non-emergent chest CT.
3. Mildly worsened interstitial abnormality, again compatible 
with pulmonary fibrosis.

___ CT NECK NON-CONTRAST:
1. No cervical spine fracture.
2. Significant degenerative change as detailed above, with 
likely
degenerative malalignment and resultant severe canal narrowing 
at C4-5, and
effacement of the thecal sac and likely deformity of the cord. 
If there is
concern for cord injury (i.e. trauma), or chronic cord malacia, 
MRI should be considered for further evaluation.
3. 1.9-cm isthmic thyroid nodule.

artorvastatin 80 mg PO QD.
.

was discharged on her home dose of Nexium.  
.  
# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Patient was continued on home dose of 
levothyroxine during admission.  
.  
# Depression: Patient was continued on home dose of Citalopram 
during admission. 
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
#Lung nodule: Patient should follow-up with PCP for possible 
further imaging of lung nodule on CXR.
#Thyroid nodule: Patient should follow-up with PCP for possible 
___ of thyroid nodule idenitified on neck CT.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ with 
increased neck pain and epigastric pain. You received a chest 
x-ray, which had findings consistent with a pneumonia. We began 
to treat you with antibiotics, which you should keep taking for 
a total of 5 days. 

We also checked to see if you had new problems with your heart. 
Your laboratory tests did not show anything concerning, but you 
had some small changes on your electrocardiogram, which can 
sometimes mean that your heart is not getting enough blood flow. 
To further investigate this, you were given a nuclear medicine 
stress test, which showed that your heart was getting enough 
blood flow and you do not require any further testing at this 
time. 

MEDICATION CHANGES:
START Levoquin-- Take 750 mg (1 pill) once a day for 4 days. 
This medication is to treat your pneumonia. It is important that 
you take all doses of this medication.  

Please continue to take all of your other home medications 
unchanged.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. Please contact your 
primary care doctor or return to the emergency room with any 
concerning symptoms.
 
Followup Instructions:
___
