History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old right-handed woman with past medical
history significant for HLD, hypothyroidism, and temporal lobe
epilepsy who presents at ___ as a code stroke for lethargy,
vision problems, diplopia and slurred speech.

Her story is somewhat confusing, she was normal this morning 
when
she woke up, and was driving when she first thought the sun was
bothering her eyes.  She was driving in the the sun and felt 
that
the light was too great and was making it difficulty to see. 
When she put the visor down she realized that it wasn't only the
sun that was causing her vision trouble.  She had the sensation
that one eye was being pushed up (she thinks it was her right
eye) and one eye was being pulled down.  It is not clear what 
she
means by this.  At the time she does not think she has double
vision, but cannot explain the vision problem well.  She doesn't
believe that there was any part of her vision that was missing,
and doesn't think the vision difficultly was on one side or the
other.  She didn't test each eye individually.  She pulled over
out of concern that she would crash and looked for her cell 
phone
to call her family, but she had left it at home .  She then
decided to drive home on her own.  She was able to get home with
her vision difficulty, however was very anxious on the ride back
and felt that she had generalized weakness.

When she got home she tried to get out of the car and had
difficulty and fell to the floor.  She did not hit her head and
it was a short distance and she didn't injure herself.  When she
attempted to walk she felt unsteady, and weak.  She felt like 
her legs were "drunk" and may have had a brief sensation of 
vertigo.  At this time her
husband found her.  He noted when she tried to talk that her
words were difficult to understand.  He was only able to make 
out
a few words.  She also noted that her speech sounded strange, 
and
she described a feeling of being unable to produce the correct
words, and felt that she could not put a whole sentence together
and was limited to short phrases of 3 words or less.  Her 
husband
also felt there may have been some drooping of the right side of
the face and the patient remembered there was some drooling out
the right side of her mouth.  Her husband thinks she was able to
understand and follow simple commands, the patient notes she was
very anxious at this time, and does not remember what her 
husband
said to her.  Given these symptoms they put her back in the car
and drove her to ___.  While in the car she noted that she was
having double vision.  She saw street signs one above the other. 

She didn't test if it improved by closing one eye.  This lasted
for at least 15 minutes.  Both her speech difficulty and her
vision problems started to resolved while she was in the car. 
She was nearly back to baseline when she arrived in the ED where
she was called as a code stroke.

She had an ___ stroke scale of 0.  Her exam was notable 
initially
for mild slowing of speech, and occasionally would drop an
article such as "the" or "my".  This rapidly resolved.

Pertinent Results:
Echo: 
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or 
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline 
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  
 

MRI head: 
No acute infarction or hemorrhage.
