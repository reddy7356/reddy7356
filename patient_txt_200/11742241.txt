CT HEAD: FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of intracranial 
hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures, 
hydrocephalus, or infarction.  Mild prominence of the ventricles 
and sulci are consistent with age-related involutional change.  
Periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are a 
nonspecific finding that can be seen in the setting of chronic 
small vessel ischemic disease.  Calcifications are noted of the 
bilateral cavernous carotid arteries.  Mucosal thickening is 
seen throughout multiple bilateral ethmoidal air cells as well 
as within the maxillary sinuses, right greater than left.  
Aerosolized secretions are also seen within the right maxillary 
sinus.  There are fluid levels within both sphenoid sinuses.  
Note is made of bilateral frontal sinus aplasia.  The mastoid 
air cells are well aerated.  No suspicious 
lytic or blastic lesions are identified. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process. 

CXR IN ED: 1.  Low position of ET tube positioned 1.4 cm above 
the carina.  Please retract by at least 1 cm for more optimal 
positioning.   
2.  NG tube tip just beyond the GE junction and can be advanced 
for more 
optimal positioning. 3.  Aerated lungs post retraction of ET 
tube. 

FISTULOGRAM, with ___ guided intervention  ___
1. RUE graft aneurysm near the arterial anastomosis and into 2 
smaller graft aneurysms near the venous anastomosis. 
2. Complete occlusion of the right subclavian vein with 
extensive collateralization, treated with angioplasty and 
eventual stenting from a ___ approach. 
3. Multiple intra-graft and right axillary stenoses treated with 
balloon angioplasty 
IMPRESSION: 
High-grade central subclavian stenosis/occlusion  status post 
successful stenting with a 14 mm x 80 mm stent. Multiple 
intra-graft and axillary stenosis were successfully dilated with 
angioplasty. The graft had a palpable following the procedure.

unresponsiveness and hypoglycemia to 17. Intubated in the field 
for concern of decreasing respirations and initially admitted to 
the MICU.

# Hypoglycemia/IDDM2: The patient gives a history of low PO 
intake and nausea/vomiting the day of presentation (___). 
Also, she has a history of poor understanding of insulin (recent 
admission with severe hypoglycemia 1 month ago), and only recent 
acquired a glucometer. She says she took her insulin in the 
morning on ___ and then was not able to eat due to n/v. 
Hypoglycemia to 17 likely the cause of AMS at presentation. 
Hypoglycemia improved after glucose administration. The patient 
was initially intubated in the field, but was quickly extuabed 
in the MICU with return of normal mental status. Insulin regmin 
was changed from home doses (70/30) to a regimin of long and 
short acting insulin (lantus and humalog) at very low doses. She 
was followed by ___ in house. She was seen by the ___ 
teaching nurse as well as the PACT program in house. The 
patient's daughter, who manages her insulin, was taught the new 
insulin regimin extensively. The patient was arranged to set up 
care with a PCP (she has no established care outpatient at this 
time), who will manage her insulin outpatient. She was also set 
to follow up with podiatry given poor nail hygeine. PACT program 
will continue to follow this patient upon discharge.

# L arm Fistula: On presentation the patient's L arm fistula was 
noted to be very pulsitile, with abscence of a thrill. She got a 
fistulogram and ___ guided balloon and stenting procedure on ___. 
Got dialysis in house on a MWF schedule. Transplant surgery 
evaluated an ulcer overlying the fistula and feels that 
non-emergent surgical intervention will likely be required since 
this area is an increased risk of bleeding. Duoderm placed over 
the site, and the patient is to follow up with Transplant 
surgery in 2 weeks..
- Continue HD per schedule, avoid placing needles or silk tape 
over the area of ulceration
- Follow up in outpatient Access clinic in 1 week

# Sinus Bradycardia: Rates down to ___ on admission, improved to 
___ after extubation. Unclear if secondary to over beta-blockade 
(as metoprolol was increased last admission), increased vagal 
tone ___ hypertension, intrinsic SA node problem. However, 
talking to the daughter it turned out the patient was not taking 
metoprolol or clonodine at home, so these were held in the 
hospital and not restarted at discharge given persistent 
bradycardia to the ___.

# Hypertension: Chronic and poorly controlled. Medications were 
uptitrated last admission. Geting HD today, BP prior to AM meds 
was elevated. Cont lisinopril, amlodipine. Held metoprolol and 
clonidine for bradycardia and since patient was not taking them 
at home. 
- ___ need further BP control outpatient

# ESRD on HD MWF: dialysis MWF. got dialysis in house
- Continue sevelamer, vitamins, nephrocaps, Doxercalciferol 
- cont Epo 6000 Units qHD 
- the patient was counseled about the importance of not missing 
HD sessions outpatient

# Guaiac Positive Stools/OGT aspirate: No evidence of clinically 
significant bleeding. H/H is above baseline, no bright red 
blood, no melena, no longer hypotensive.  
- Continue Famotidine for GERD and monitor for evidence of 
bleeding
- likely needs outpatient colonoscopy
 
# Episodes of hypoxia last admission: Unclear etiology. Not 
currently an active issue. Patient satting well on RA. CTA 
negative for PE last admission but motion limited study. Stable 
for now so will continue to monitor.

# Mediastinal lymphadenopathy on CT scan 
-should be followed by surveillance CT in 6 months. 

# HLD: continue pravastatin, ASA

# PPX: heparin

# CODE: Full code 
 
# CONTACT: ___ ___, ___ (granddaughter), 
___ (uncle) 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
- It is very important for this patient to establish care with a 
PCP who can manage her HTN and insulin
- Continue HD per schedule, avoid placing needles or silk tape 
over the area of ulceration on fistula
- Follow up in outpatient Access clinic in 1 week
- F/U with podiatry for diabetic foot care
- Mediastinal lymphadenopathy on CT scan should be followed by 
surveillance CT in 6 months.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted for low blood sugar and 
unresponsiveness. You were intubated and admitted to the 
intensive care unit, but improved and could be extubated. Your 
blood sugar responded to glucose administration. Your insulin 
regimen was changed to a more gentle regimen. It is important 
that you stop using the insulin pen and the 70/30 insulin which 
you were previously using before, and only use the new insulin 
which we will prescribe at discharge (with long acting Lantus 
and short acting Humalog). We will also send you home with 
glucose pills in case your sugar is to become dangerously low 
again.

It is important that you take all medications as prescribed, and 
keep all follow up appointments.

IMAGING/REPORTS
===============================
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
In comparison with the study of ___, there has been 
total collapse of
the left lung with displacement of mediastinal structures to 
this side.  The
right lung remains essentially clear.
 
CT CHEST
IMPRESSION:
1. Complete occlusion of the left mainstem bronchus with near 
complete
collapse of the left upper lobe due to filling of the bronchus 
with soft
tissue density material, possibly reflective of mucous plugging, 
though a
neoplastic lesion cannot be completely excluded on this 
noncontrast exam. 
Correlation with bronchoscopy is recommended.
2. Small apical predominant left pleural effusion, suggesting 
loculation.
3. Subpleural solid nodules within the right lung measuring up 
to 6 mm, new
from the prior exam.  See recommendations section below 
regarding need for
follow-up chest CT imaging.
4. Ground-glass centrilobular nodular opacities in the right 
lower lobe
suggests small airways disease, either infectious or 
inflammatory in etiology.
5. Numerous enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, which may be 
reactive.
6. Wedge-shaped hypodensity within the spleen, which may be due 
to prior
infarction.
RECOMMENDATION(S):
1. Bronchoscopy is recommended for further assessment of the 
endobronchial
soft tissue density.
2. For incidentally detected multiple solid pulmonary nodules 
measuring 6 to 8
mm, a CT follow-up in 3 to 6 months is recommended in a low-risk 
patient, with
an optional CT follow-up in 18 to 24 months. In a high-risk 
patient, both a CT
follow-up in 3 to 6 months and in 18 to 24 months is 
recommended.See the ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ was a ___ woman with a history of paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation, prior strokes with residual dysarthria, 
dependent for ADLs, end-stage renal disease on dialysis who was 
transferred from ___ with hypoglycemia and found 
to be hypoxemic with near complete collapse of left upper lung.  


Workup was notable for complete occlusion of the left mainstem 
bronchus with near complete collapse of the left upper lobe due 
to filling of the bronchus with soft tissue density that was 
thought to be due to mucous plugging.  Her clinical status was 
initially very reassuring.  She was asymptomatic with good 
oxygen saturation on room air.  The case was discussed with 
interventional pulmonology service.  After discussion with the 
family regarding the potential treatment options, the patient 
and family opted to pursue conservative measures with mucinex, 
acapella valve, chest physical therapy, and treatment for 
community-acquired pneumonia.  

The following morning, the patient developed coughing after 
taking her morning medications and then became unresponsive 
without a pulse.  Attempts were made to perform the Heimlich 
maneuver and the oropharnyx was examined for foreign body.  
Despite these attempts, the patient passed away on ___ at 
8:17AM (please see death note in OMR).

BASOS-0.___ woman with ESRD on HD who presents to ED with clotted 
graft, c/b hyperkalemia.  

# ESRD c/b Hyperkalemia: AV graft clotted, seen by transplant, 
renal, and ___ who recommended attempted thrombectomy with plans 
for tunneled line placement if unsucessful. The patient received 
medical management of her hyperkalemia including insulin, 
dextrose, kayexcelate with minimal improvement in her 
hyperkalemia. She then had a thrombectomy, fistulagram, stenting 
and balloon angioplasty of her fistula which resulted in patency 
of her graft. She then had HD ___ with resolution of her 
hyperkalemia. She received a low K, low phos diet and her 
sevelemer and nephrocaps were continued. Her lisinopril and 
losartan were held for hyperkalemia and her lisinopril was 
re-started after HD. 

# Productive cough: The patient had bibasilar decreased breath 
sounds and a productive cough on exam which she states is her 
baseline. These findings are likely due to underlying COPD given 
her history of smoking. She remained afebrile and WBC count was 
normal throughout hospitalization so there was no concern for 
pneumonia. Her oxygen saturation was stable in the low 90's 
while hospitalized.

# DM: Taken off insulin recently. Her blood sugars were stable 
while hospitalized. 
 
# HTN: Poorly controlled, on admission hypertensive to 
180's-190's. Her home medications of hydralazine and amlodipine 
were continued but lisinopril and losartan were held for 
hyperkalemia on admission. Her hydralazine was up-titrated to 50 
TID for 25 TID, but her blood pressures remained in the 170's 
until she received HD as volume overload was likely a 
contributing factor. After her first dialysis session, her blood 
pressure was under much better control. Her lisinopril was 
re-started once her hyperkalemia resolved, and her losartan was 
discontinued to prevent future episodes of hyperkalemia.

# Anemia: Likely due to ESRD. Her H/H trended down from 
admission when it was ___ to the second hospital day when it 
was ___ after her interventional radiology procedure. This 
acute decrease was attributed to blood loss during her 
procedure. She received 2U PRBC's and her post-transfusion H/H 
increased appropriately to 8.7/28.

# GERD: Stable, continued home pantoprazole while hospitalized.

# H/o CVA: Baseline slurred speech, mild L facial droop. Her 
home aspirin was continued while hospitalized.

# AFib: Diagnosed in ___, CHADS2VASC of 6. Per records patient 
not on anti-coagulation as she has declined coumadin in the 
past. Her heart rates were stable in the ___ with no rate 
control medications.

Transitional Issues:

# HTN-Please assess BP control as an outpatient on her new 
anti-hypertensive regimen.

# Compliance-The patient has missed dialysis frequently as an 
outpatient and has poor compliance with physician ___. 
SW consulted to provide resources as an outpatient. 

# Anemia-Patient's anemia attributed to ESRD and blood loss 
following procedure. Please check her H/H as an outpatient and 
assess need for epo/iron supplementation during HD.

# A fib with CHADS2VASC score of 6 with an annual stroke risk of 
___ medical record patient has previously declined coumadin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___. You were admitted 
because you were unable to get dialysis due to a clot in your 
fistula. Your potassium levels were dangerously high because of 
your inability get dialysis. We treated your high potassium and 
monitored it frequently while you were admitted to make sure it 
was not too high. To evaluate your fistula, you underwent a 
fistulagram with interventional radiology and had a procedure to 
remove the clot from the fistula. You received dialysis while 
you were with us and this corrected your abnormally high 
potassium. We also heard that you often miss dialysis which is 
very dangerous. You met with a social worker to ensure that you 
have all the resources at home to make your dialysis and other 
doctor appointments. We noted you to be taking one medication 
for your blood pressure (losartan) which we feel is unecessary.  
We would like you to stop taking it. We also increased another 
blood pressure medication (hydralazine) to keep your blood 
pressure in the normal range. You can see these changes as well 
as your complete medication list in the medication 
reconciliation attached. We wish you all the best in your 
continued recovery.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was admitted to the ___ Stroke service due to a 
stroke. Her stroke was likely due to a combination of factors 
including smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, and new onset 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation picked up on telemetry. We have 
increased her aspirin to prevent further strokes. She underwent 
routine dialysis while in the hospital. Despite refusing insulin 
several times we suggested that she regularly check her blood 
sugar and follow up with her primary provider to discuss 
restarting insulin, she required 14 units of insulin one day and 
6 units the following day. She did not want to go back to 
___ management. We have discussed the 
risks and ___ of anticoagulation due to Afib, and she 
declined starting anticoagulation medication. In addition, we 
suggested that she go to ___ rehab, however she also 
declined this recommendation as well. We therefore suggested 
home physical, speech, and occupational therapy. We suggested 
she get an outpatient echo to r/o clot or other function 
deficits, although she would likely refuse anticoagulation at 
this time as well.

PERTINENT IMAGING:

CXR: AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous 
exams 
from ___ and ___.  Again seen are 
indistinct 
pulmonary vascular markings.  There is no effusion.  Cardiac 
silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.  No acute osseous 
abnormality is detected. 
IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema without superimposed acute 
consolidation. 

CTPA:
1.  There is no central PE; however, because of motion artifact, 
the exam is
non-conclusive distally.  There is no acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Possible elevated right heart pressure with reflux of 
contrast in inferior
vena cava and hepatic veins.
3.  Mildly enlarged central lymph nodes are of unknown 
chronicity.
4.  Possible tracheobronchomalacia.
5.  No significant lung process.

LUNG SCAN:
Prominent cardiac silhouette and elevated right hemidiaphragm. 
Scattered
non-segmental perfusion defects are matched on ventilation 
images. There is no
evidence of right lung abnormality. 
 
Chest x-ray shows mild to moderate pulmonary edema and 
cardiomegaly. No focal
opacities. 
 
IMPRESSION: Low likelihood ratio for acute pulmonary embolism.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with T2DM, ESRD on HD and HTN who presents with hypoglycemia 
and developed hypoxia in the ED. 
 
#Hypoxia: Pt had one episode of desat in the ED which was 
initially thought to be due to pulmonary edema given the 
patient's missed HD two times over the previous week. However, 
after dialysis and 4L taken off, pt continued to have hypoxia on 
room air. Of note, she would be asymptomatic and breathing 
normally during these times. ABG and CXR were unrevealing. Her 
exam was notable for wheezing bilaterally, so she was treated 
with a steroid burst and azithromycin for likely RAD (recent URI 
symptoms in addition to smoking history). Her wheezing improved, 
however she continued to have episodes of hypoxia on room air. 
CTPA was performed to rule out PE, and this was inconclusive due 
to motion artifact. A lung scan revealed low probability PE. The 
only notable finding on her CT was intermittent collapse of the 
trachea likely due to tracheobronchomalacia. Interventional 
pulmonology was consulted, who felt this was unlikely causing 
her hypoxia and would not require treatment if she was not 
symptomatic. Over the next ___ days, no further hypoxic episodes 
were observed. She breathed comfortably on room air. She was 
discharge with recommendations to have outpatient sleep studies 
and pulmonary function tests. 

#T2DM and Hypoglycemia: Likely due to poor PO intake in the 
setting of URI symptoms and continuing her long acting insulin. 
Last A1c was 5.9% in ___. She appears to have a poor 
understanding of managing her chronic illnesses. Has also missed 
recent outpatient appts at HCA. She had minimal requirements on 
ISSH, suggesting either her insulin dose at home was too high or 
she has been eating less here at the hospital. Once pt was 
started on steroids for respiratory problems, her blood sugars 
increased. ___ was consulted due to her poor diabetic 
control, and they recommended an outpatient regimen of 70/30 - 
20 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner. The patient 
was counseled heavily on her insulin regimen and given 
contingency instructions for when her sugars remain too low. 

#HTN: Initially felt to be due to missed HD appointments, fluid 
overload, and poor medication compliance. She was continued on 
home amlodipine, metoprolol, and clonidine patch with continued 
poor control. Lisinopril was added and uptitrated to 10mg daily. 
This can be further uptitrated as an outpatient.

#ESRD on HD: Missed last 2 sessions due to illness. No urgent 
infications for HD at admission. Continued MWF HD with daily 
chem-10 to monitor electrolytes. Continued sevelamer, folic 
acid, and vit B complex. 
 
#HLD: continued pravastatin, ASA

#GERD: contined pepcid 

Transitional issues:
#Recommended for further workup of hypoxia: outpatient sleep 
study and PFTs, dedicated imaging of the trachea for diagnosis 
of TBM
#HTN: uptitrate lisinopril as needed
#Hypoglycmia: titrate new 70/30 regimen as needed to avoid lows 
and/or highs

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ for low blood sugars. You were seen 
by diabetes specialists, who recommended you use the following 
regimen at home: 20 units of insulin 70/30 with breakfast and 10 
units of insulin 70/30 with dinner. Please call your PCP or the 
diabetes doctor if your finger sticks are repeatedly less than 
90 or more than 150. If you skip a meal, please cut the doses of 
insulin in half for that meal.

While you were here, your oxygen levels were periodically low. 
You were given steroids and azithromycin to help with wheezing. 
You had multiple studies done which eventually showed a collapse 
of your upper airway while breathing, called 
tracheobronchomalacia. For further workup of this problem, we 
recommend some outpatient studies, including pulmonary function 
test, sleep study, and others. Your primary care physician can 
order these for after you have left the hospital.

Please be sure to go to dialysis every time, even if you do not 
feel well. Lastly, you were started on a medicine called 
lisinopril for your high blood pressures.

We made the following changes to your medications:
STOP NPH insulin
START insulin 70/30
START prednisone daily through ___
START azithromycin daily through ___
START albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath
START lisinopril 
START nephrocaps
CHANGE metoprolol tartrate 50mg twice a day to metoprolol 
succinate XL 100mg daily

IMAGING:
========
___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
IMPRESSION:  
In comparison with the study of ___, patient has taken a 
better inspiration.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac 
silhouette with some elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.  No 
evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Vascular stenting is seen in 
the right upper zone. 

___ Imaging MRI & MRA BRAIN 
IMPRESSION:  
Severe acute subcortical infarct in the left centrum semiovale 
and possible late subacute infarct in the right centrum 
semiovale.  Several colonic infarcts are seen with T2 shine 
through in the centrum semiovale.  Extensive changes of small 
vessel disease and brain atrophy seen.  Chronic micro 
hemorrhages as before.  Normal MRA of the head. 

___ Imaging MRA NECK W/O CONTRAST 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Similar appearance of the bilateral vertebral and internal 
carotid 
arteries, compared to the prior exam from ___, however please 
note that this study is limited secondary to mild motion 
artifact. 
2. Attenuated appearance of the origins of the bilateral 
external carotid arteries appear similar to the prior exam and 
may be artifactual, however a focal stenosis cannot be excluded. 
 A CTA of the neck may be helpful for further evaluation. 

___
CONCLUSIONS: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial 
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal 
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The 
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue 
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling 
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. 
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is 
no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
regional and global biventricular systolic function. No 
pathologic flow identified. Increased PCWP. (Left Ventricle - 
Ratio E/E': *22. No PFO or atrial thrombus found.)
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/PMHx HTN, paroxysmal afib, ESRD on HD (T/TH), and stroke 
admitted to referring hospital on ___ with lip/tongue 
angioedema and found to have acute strokes during hospital 
work-up for persistent dysarthria, thought to be secondary to 
atrial fibrillation and patient was started on Warfarin.

#Angioedema
Swelling of lip and tongue evaluated by ___ allergy and 
determined to be most likely secondary to ACEi-associated 
angioedema (given lack of improvement with 
antihistamines/steroids, prolonged time course, and lack of 
urticarial/pruritis/bronchospasm). Lisinopril was discontinued 
and added to allergy list. Patient was initially treated with 
methylpred 80 mg IV q8, famotidine 20 mg IV, and fexofenadine. 
Patient's lip and tongue swelling improved. 

#Acute cardioembolic stroke 
Despite improvement of angioedema throughout hospital course, 
patient's dysarthria did not improve, prompting neurologic 
workup. MRI showed severe acute subcortical infarct in the left 
centrum semiovale and possible late subacute infarct in the 
right centrum semiovale. Strokes most likely cardioembolic in 
nature, given evidence of atrial fibrillation on EKG and 
telemetry. Per neurology recommendations, patient was started on 
anticoagulation. She was discharged on Warfarin 5mg with Aspirin 
325mg bridge that will need to be continued after patient 
therapeutic on warfarin for 48 hours (Aspirin can be 
discontinued if INR therapeutic on ___. 

#Atrial Fibrillation
Tele and EKG with evidence of intermittent atrial fibrillation, 
which was diagnosed in ___ following first stroke. Refused 
Patietn has been started on warfarin. Patient has appropriate 
rate and does not require pharmacologic rate control. Received 
TTE with bubble study; no evidence of PFO. 

#HTN  
Discontinued Lisinopril and added to allergy list. Patient 
started on Losartan and maintained on home Amlodipine 10mg and 
Hydralazine 50mg q8 hours for blood pressure control. Patient 
may require uptitration of hypertension regimen with Labetolol. 

#AV graft aneurysm/ESRD 
Patient has 5cm area in AV graft concerning for chronic 
psuedoaneurysm. Patient was evaluated by transplant surgery, who 
did not recommend any acute surgical intervention. Dialysis on 
___ schedule.

#Type II Diabetes Mellitus  
Patient has history of DM, but not taken any meds or insulin at 
home. A1c taken ___ is 5.61%. FBGs ranged in 300s on ___ and 
___, most likely in the setting of steroids. Her blood glucose 
has remained under 200 after steroids were stopped. Patient has 
not required insulin and was not discharged on medication for 
DM. 

#Microcytic anemia
Most likely secondary to kidney failure. Initiated 
erythropoietin with dialysis. ___ also have component of anemia 
of chronic disease, given elevated ferritin levels (although 
last measured in ___. 

#GERD  
Continue home Pantoprazole.
 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- New allergy: LISINOPRIL (angioedema)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized at ___ because you had swelling of your 
lips and tongue. We think that your tongue and lips swelled up 
because of an allergic reaction to the blood pressure medication 
that you were previously taking (lisinopril). While you were 
here, we stopped the offending blood pressure medication and put 
you on some medications to help with the swelling. Your swelling 
has resolved.

We also noticed that you had some difficulty speaking, even when 
your tongue swelling went down. We obtained an image of your 
brain called an MRI, which showed that you had new strokes. We 
think that you had additional strokes because of a heart 
condition that you have called atrial fibrillation which can 
lead to clots that can travel to the brain. 

We started you on a blood thinner called warfarin, which 
prevents clots from forming. When you go home, you will take 
warfarin, but you need to get frequent blood tests to make sure 
that the medication is at the right level in your body. 
Additionally, we discontinued the blood pressure medication 
(lisinopril) that caused your lip and tongue to swell. We 
started you on a new blood pressure medication (losartan) to 
replace the old blood pressure medication that we stopped.

Your appointments and medications are below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!
Your ___ Care Team

from prior.  Ventricles and sulci and unremarkable.  Basilar 
cisterns are
patent.  Dense atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the 
intracranial
ICAs bilaterally.
 
There is thickening of the sphenoid sinus and right maxillary 
sinus walls
suggesting prior chronic inflammation with minimal mucosal 
thickening present
in the right maxillary sinus.  Remaining paranasal sinuses are 
clear noting
poor pneumatization of the frontal sinuses.
 
IMPRESSION: 
 
No acute intracranial process, no hemorrhage.  White matter 
changes which are
likely sequela of chronic small vessel disease.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ lady with DM2, ESRD on HD (TuThSa), Hx of CVA

family concern over soft stool and speech but found to be at 
baseline. On further questioning, it seemed that patient was at 
baseline and only worsens with missing  not taking medications 
and possibly missing HD.

# Dysarthria, intermittent - due to old stroke. Stable per pt 
and prior notes. Neuro exam w/o additional acute findings. CT 
head on admission w/o acute processes. Daughter ___ reports 
that patient has intermittent worsening of her speech at home 
when she does not take her medications or go to HD possibly from 
hypertension or metabolic derangements. ___ agrees that 
speech has been intermittently slurred several times per week 
since her original stroke. Encouraged patient to continue HD and 
control blood pressure. Out patient neurology visit arranged.

last month. She has been incontinent of stool since her CVA and 
uses adult diapers at home. Her daughter is frustrated with 
increasing number of changes required. Soft bowel movements ___ 
daily can still be within the normal range of GI function. There 
is no leukocytosis. Abd exam benign. Patient without sick 
contacts or other infectious symptoms. Likely secondary to diet.
#Diabetes: Patient not on oral hypoglycemic or insulin at home, 
states that a doctor told her she no longer needed it. A1C 7.6 
on ___. Not on medications possibly due to liberalized A1C 
target of 8. Can re-evaluate need for control with PMD.
#Functional status: Patient is incontinent and bedbound. MOCA 
___ suggesting dementia. Daughter appears unable to provide

# Altered mental status 
# Slurred speech
# Macroglossia: Given high stroke risk (CHADSVASC 8) and history 
of multiple prior CVAs, neurology consulted though did not 
suspect her presentation was consistent with a neurological 
process and did not recommend further imaging. Suspect enlarged
tongue with associated drooling was associated a possible drug 
reaction though the family denied administering any new drugs. 
No signs or symptoms of infection. Maintained airway and 
secretions without any issues. Resolved back to baseline without 
any issues. Evaluated by speech and swallow and recommended 
modified baseline diet (see discharge diet). 

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:
She is on warfarin at home, though with an INR of 1.1 at 
admission. Through discussion with daughter/caretaker it appears 
she is not followed by an ___ clinic and her dose 
has not been adjusted in some time. Suboptimal dosing and 
difficulty taking medication likely contributing. Given prior 
history of strokes and high vascular risk (CHADS VASC 8), 
neurology recommended bridging the patient with a heparin drip.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to ___ with swollen tongue, drooling and 
confusion after dialysis. This resolved while you were here

Our neurologists did not suspect you to have another stroke. 
While you were here we found your INR (blood test that we 
monitor on Coumadin) to be 1.1 (it should be ___. Because of 
your history of prior strokes, we started you on an IV blood 
thinner and transitioned you back to your Coumadin at a higher

Coumadin is at the right level. It is now safe for you to go 
home. It was a pleasure caring for you. 

Wishing you the best,

Your ___ Team
