Imaging:
RUQ US 
IMPRESSION:  
  
1. Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other 
forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including 
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on 
this study.  
  
2. A 1 cm echogenic structure with posterior shadowing adjacent 
to the 
gallbladder fossa is identified. Given the history of 
malignancy, MR is 
recommended for further evaluation.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Periumbilical pain: Etiology of abdominal pain is uncertain at 
the time of discharge. It is most likely secondary to ventral 
hernia repair as she began experiencing pain several months 
following procedure. It has been chronic, ___ pain which is 
unchanged with eating further supporting diagnosis. She was 
found to have an elevated lipase over 300 this admission. She 
has no clinical findings or history supportive of either acute 
or chronic pancreatitis. LFTs normal lowering suspicion for 
biliary process. Peptic ulcer disease is possible, but also less 
likely with no change in symptoms with eating, no previous acid 
reflux, and no hx of prolonged NSAID use. A RUQ ultrasound 
raised concern for an cystic structure in region of gallbladder 
but it unclear if this is new (liver cyst prev seen on CT) or if 
it is contributing to current presentation. Given this finding 
and elevated lipase, recommend further imaging (MRI vs CT 
dedicated pancreatic study) as an outpt. 
 
# HTN: Stable this admission. Continued home lisinopril.  

# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: she was kept on insulin during 
hospitalization and metformin and glyburide were restarted at 
time of discharge.

Transitions of Care:
#Pt will follow up with surgery for further evaluation of hernia
#Pt should have further pancreatic imaging in setting of 
elevated lipase

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of at ___ 
___. You came in with abdominal pain that you have 
been experiencing for the last several months. We think this is 
most likely related to your previous surgeries. However, your 
lipase (an enzyme made by the pancreas) was also elevated and 
should be followed up as an outpatient by your PCP.
