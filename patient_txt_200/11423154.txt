PROCEDURE
======================
PROCEDURE: ___ 
1. Left radial artery access. 
2. Right uterine arteriogram. 
3. 3 vials of 500-700 micron particles and 2 vials of 700-900 
micron particle 
embolization embolization of the right uterine artery to near 
stasis. 
4. Left uterine arteriogram. 
5. 3.5 vials of 500-700 micron particle embolization of the left 
uterine 
artery to near stasis. 
6. Aortogram extending to the superficial femoral arteries. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of 
fibromyalgia, atypical ductal hyperplasia on tamoxifen, chronic 
back pain, and symptomatic uterine fibroids, SLE (unclear 
diagnosis per OMR), admitted post uterine fibroid embolization 
for pain control and vital sign monitoring.  

# bilateral lower quadrant abdominal pain  s/p uterine fibroid 
embolization:
Patient with symptomatic uterine fibroids s/p left radial artery 
access bilateral uterine artery particle embolization to near 
status. Left radial access site without bleeding. Patient with 
significant pain post procedure requiring overnight dilaudid 
PCA. Transitioned on post procedure day 1 to PO 
hydrocodone-acetaminophen, and dilaudid PCA successfully 
discontinued. However on post procedure day 2 the patient had 
continued pain despite hydrocodone-acetaminophen, and tramadol 
was added. This was because the patient had a previous 
intolerance to oxycodone, and uptitration of 
hydrocodone-acetaminophen limited by maximum acetaminophen 
dosing. The patient's pain was better controlled on this 
regimen. She was tolerating PO well and ambulating without 
difficulty prior to discharge. Sarna lotion was added for 
pruritus. Patient will be contacted by ___, and will have plans 
for 3 month follow up MRI for evaluation.

# Fever: 
Patient spiked fever overnight on post procedure day 1 to 101.2 
while receiving acetaminophen of unclear etiology. The patient 
had no pulmonary or GU symptoms. CXR negative for pneumonia, UA 
bland. Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and pending 
on discharge. The patient remained afebrile for the remaining 
duration of the hospital course and remained hemodynamically 
stable throughout. Upon discussion with interventional 
radiology, low grade fevers likely expected post embolization, 
and were comfortable with discharge given negative infectious 
workup and improvement in pain. 

=======================
CHRONIC ISSUES
=======================
# Fibromyalgia: Patient continued home pregabalin 100 mg BID, 
duloxetine 60 mg QHS, tizanidine 4 mg daily. Patient on chronic 
hydrocodone-acetaminophen at baseline which was titrated as 
described above.

# Cognitive impairment NOS: Patient on home Namenda, confirmed 
in OMR. Continued while inpatient

# Anemia: Patient with history of normocytic anemia with 
previous workup in ___ with elevated ferritin, no iron level 
sent at the time. Patient H/H stable during the admission. 
Continued on home iron.

# GERD: Patient continued home sucralfate BID and omeprazole 
BID.

# Atypical ductal hyperplasia: Patient continued home tamoxifen 
daily.

# Depression: Patient continued home duloxetine.

# Allergic rhinitis: Patient continued fluticasone.

# Insomnia: Patient continued home trazodone.

=======================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=======================
[ ] Patient should only be continued on tramadol for short 
course given medication interactions
[ ] Ensure follow up with GI given history of black stools 
reported per patient prior to admission
[ ] Check CBC at next PCP visit to trend hemoglobin in setting 
of anemia and uterine fibroid embolization
[ ] Patient will need follow up MRI in 3 months post procedure
[ ] Ensure follow up with ___ in clinic

Chief Complaint:
Paroxysmal episodes

 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

 
History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a ___ woman PMHx atypical ductal
hyperplasia, fibromyalgia and possible lupus (unclear diagnosis
per records and patient) and recurrent paroxysmal events since
___ who presents to the ___ ED with recurrent paroxysmal
events.

Neurologic history is listed below. Regarding her current
presentation, pt reports feeling like her usual self this AM. 
She
ate breakfast uneventfully. Around 9:30a, she was preparing for 
a
neuropsychiatric appointment scheduled for today when she
received a phone call from her transportation asking if they
could pick her up sooner. She had missed two prior appointments
for neuropsychiatric testing and was concerned she may not make
an earlier ride and thus felt very stressed. She quickly tried 
to
get ready and put on sneakers. She then started to "gasp for
breath" and feel anxious and began shaking. She fell onto her
bed. Her daughter arrived who observed bilateral arm and leg
jerking, the arms were jerking moreso than the legs (seemed
asynchronous when I asked daughter to act out). There was no eye
deviation, urinary incontinence or tongue bite. Pt reports being
unable to have a conversation during this time period but she
felt "somewhat aware of something going on around me". Daughter
then called her father who recommended calling EMS. Daughter
reports episode stopped when EMS arrived and had lasted about 10
minutes.

En route to the hospital, pt had a recurrent episode and per
EMS/ED pt was "verbally responsive during shaking spell". 
Further
details unclear. This again lasted ~10 minutes and then 
resolved.
Pt then had a recurrent episode in the ED observed by staff 
where
"patient is not verbally interactive. Has twitching of arms and
face and moves eyes. But able to respond to some commands."
Neurology was then consulted.

At the time of my assessment, pt had returned to her baseline. 
No
abnormal movements were observed and she had no complaints. She
has not had any recent fevers or headache. Her last event was in
___. 

Regarding her neurologic history, her events are as such:

(1) Episodes with memory lapses
(2) Episodes with difficulty talking or inability to talk 
(3) Episodes of leg stiffening eye deviation and pelvic
thrusting. During one episode in past, awareness was maintained. 

(4) Numbness around mouth and left arm and left arm pain which 
progresses to difficulty talking, generalized shaking, eye
fluttering. She is able to follow commands.

Potential Triggers:
(1) C/o feeling off when has menses - weak and tired. She had 
one
of these when at recent gyn visit for uterine fibroids
(2) Stress - had event on day of gyn surgery in past 

Prior Work-Up:
LP (___): Routine studies, ACE, MS profile, cytology negative

MRI Brain +/- (___):
1. 4 mm linear area of enhancement within the left frontal lobe,
with subtle possible FLAIR hyperintensity and magnetic
susceptibility, is incompletely evaluated secondary to extensive
motion artifact (17;17).  Attention on close interval followup 
or
repeat study when patient is able to tolerate exam, is 
recommended, to exclude a focus of metastases.  No other 
definite
concerning lesions identified. 
2. No acute intracranial abnormalities identified. 

EEG (___):
Normal extended routine EEG, mostly in drowsiness and sleep.
There were no areas of prominent focal slowing, and there were 
no
epileptiform features. A tachycardia was noted. 

She has never been on AEDs. She was recommended to have LTM in
___ however she did not arrange this.

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video-EEG 
monitoring session because of 3  prolonged ___ minutes) 
clinical events of side-to-side head shaking and irregular 
asynchronous floppy jerking of both arms, often with eyes 
closed, or  with eyes open and repetitive blinking. She is 
unresponsive or has slowed  responses during the events. EEG 
during these events showed only movement and  electrode 
artifact, with no ictal discharges; normal posterior dominant 
rhythm  is seen during and immediately following the events. 
Clinically and  electrographically, these are consistent with 
nonepileptic psychogenic events. 
No electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges are 
present. 

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video-EEG 
monitoring session because of a  single prolonged event 
characterized by side-to-side head shaking, irregular  
asynchronous jerking of both arms, repetitive blinking, upward 
eye deviation,  and slowed response to questions, lasting a 
total of 8 minutes. Aside for  movement artifact, no other 
electrographic correlate is seen. These findings  are consistent 
with a psychogenic nonepileptic seizure. Otherwise, the waking  
background consists of a normal alpha frequency posterior 
dominant rhythm. No 
electrographic seizures or epileptiform discharges are present. 

EEG ___: IMPRESSION: This is a normal video-EEG monitoring 
session. There are no  focal, lateralizing, epileptiform 
features in this recording. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
 ___ woman PMHx atypical ductal hyperplasia, 
fibromyalgia and possible lupus (unclear diagnosis per records 
and patient) and recurrent paroxysmal events since
___ who presents to the ___ ED with recurrent paroxysmal 
events, diagnosed with PNES this admission.

# PNES:
- She was admitted in the setting of events (as per HPI) prior 
to neuropsychiatric appointment.  She was admitted to the BI for 
event capture and formal diagnosis.  She was established on 
cvEEG with multiple typical events captured over several days.  
As per the EEG report she had "prolonged ___ minutes) clinical 
events of side-to-side head shaking and irregular asynchronous 
floppy jerking of both arms, often with eyes closed, or  with 
eyes open and repetitive blinking. She is unresponsive or has 
slowed  responses during the events.".  Remainder of EEG benign. 
 

The capture typical events were felt to be sufficient to 
diagnose her with Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures or events.  
This was discussed with the patient extensively.  The 
alternative management of this (as compared to epileptic 
seizures) were discussed- as was the importance of 
multidisciplinary outpatient follow-up.  She will follow-up with 
Neurology and Psychiatry (___) to help manage her care.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
   You were admitted to ___ for evaluation of multiple events 
of limb jerking and altered awareness.  The hopes of this 
admission were to determine whether these events were Epileptic 
Seizures or Non-Epileptic Events, as the treatment of these two 
things is different.  You evaluated by the Neurology team and 
monitored on EEG (a test which looks at the brain's electrical 
activity as part of seizure detection).
   Fortunately, your EEG did not show evidence of seizures or 
seizure like activity.  Your doctors feel ___ have ___ 
Non-epileptic events (PNEE).  These are a "stress response", 
which can sometimes look similar to seizures, but are different.
   Psychogenic Non-epileptic events are caused by social and 
psychiologic stress.  They are best treated by outpatient 
Neurology and Psychiatry to help address the underlying issues.  
For this, your doctors recommend ___ make an appointment to see 
a psychiatrist (___).
    Also, please know that according to ___ Law you 
cannot drive for 6 months following your last event.
    It was a pleasure taking care of you,
Your ___ Care Team

Date of Birth:  ___             Sex:   F
 
Service: NEUROLOGY
 
Allergies: 
Aspirin / Naproxen / Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) / Percocet

Attending: ___
 
Chief Complaint:
Possible first time seizure. 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ with hx of fibromyalgia, atypical
ductal hyperplasia on tamoxifen, chronic back pain, uterine
fibroids, SLE (unclear diagnosis per OMR) here with event
concerning for seizure. 

Pt is currently unable to provide a coherent history - the below
is obtained from multiple residents involved in her code. 
When reassessed later in the evening, she can produce coherent
speech - however, she speaks very slowly and softly, saying that
she was at ___ and they were asking her to do an exercise that 
she
was having trouble perform due to pain her leg. She then pauses
appearing somnolent and is unable to tell me exactly what
happened or what she remembers. 

She was undergoing ___ session today at around 1pm in ___ 2
when she had an episode reportedly some kind of convulsive
activity. Per Onc attending who saw the patient at that time, 
her
arms and legs were extended and stiff with rightward eye
deviation all lasting 1 min or less. Afterwards, she localized 
to
pain and had possible ?upbeating nystagmus. Code Blue was called
for unresponsiveness. When the Code Team arrived they found her
somnolent, not answering questions or following commands,
appearing "postictal". She was given 2mg IM Ativan at this time
for unclear reasons but seemed more responsive after the dose -
she would follow/track a finger on command and would nod to
questions without producing any speech. After several minutes,
she started arching back, pelvic thrusting, extending arms and
legs but was following commands throughout to track finger and
tried to open her mouth when asked as well. This lasted 2 min
total and resolved with 2mg IV Ativan. 

Finger stick in the ED was 52, pt was given dextrose. 

She is unable to respond to ROS accurately at the time of
interview.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was observed in the ED then admitted to the neurology 
service, where her mental status was noted to improve. Lab 
workup was unrevealing aside from hypoglycemia at time of event 
(52). Repeat glucose checks >70 throughout hospitalization. Her 
mental status was noted to improve and to return to baseline. 
She underwent routine EEG which was normal. She had MRI brain 
with contrast which revealed 4 mm linear area of enhancement 
within the left frontal lobe, with subtle 
possible FLAIR hyperintensity and magnetic susceptibility, 
possible artifact vs small lesion. The clinical significance of 
this finding was unclear.  For further workup, she had an LP for 
which routine studies were negative; ACE and MS profile pending. 
Arrangements were made for patient to follow up in Neuro urgent 
care at soonest available appointment.  At the time of 
discharge, she reported feeling at her baseline, denying back 
pain, nausea/vomiting or other neurologic symptoms.  

Transitional issues:
1) To follow up with Neuro-urgent care clinic after discharge
2)  Should follow up with Psychiatry  as an outpatient for 
anxiety (had several panic attacks during hospitalization) 
3) Follow up LP results when seen by Neurology in follow up

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted following an episode of altered consciousness 
associated with shaking which was concerning for a first time 
seizure. While you were admitted, you had a brain wave test 
(EEG) which was normal and image (MRI) which revealed a small 
area of abnormality in the brain, but it is unclear if this 
explains your symptoms. To look into your symptoms further, we 
did a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for which preliminary studies 
were negative.  It will be important that you follow up in 
Neurology clinic at soonest available appointment to discuss the 
rest of your results.

It was a pleasure taking care of you.

Sincerely,
Your ___ care team
