Cardiac Catheterization ___
right dominant.
LMCA: normal 
LAD: large caliber vessel; no stenosis 
LCx: large caliber vessel; no stenosis 
RCA: large caliber vessel; no stenosis 
Findings
• Elevated left heart filling pressure.
• No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
• Mean aortic gradient of 56 mmHg

Transesophageal Echocardiogram ___
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast 
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus is seen in the 
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely 
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve 
area <1.0cm2). Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is 
moderate (by PHT/mean) to severe (by PISA) valvular mitral 
stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
thickening and calcification of both mitral valves, especially 
the A2 scallop. There is no pericardial effusion. Intrinsic LV 
function may be more depressed given the valvular lesions above.
Post-bypass:
The patient is s/p mitral valve replacement and aortic valve 
replacement and paced on a norepinephrine infusion.
1) LV function now slightly more depressed in the setting of 
inotropic support.
2) There is a well-seated mechanical mitral valve no PVL and 8 
peak/4 mean gradients.
3) There is a well-seated mechanical aortic valve no PVL and 22 
peak/10 mean gradients.
4) Other valvular function unchanged.
5) All visualized portions of aorta intact. 
 
Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of ___ 
10:02 AM 
Final Report:    
Comparison to ___.  In the interval, pre-existing 
minimal 
pleural effusions have increased in extent and are now moderate. 
 The cause moderate bilateral basilar atelectasis.  The size of 
the cardiac silhouette has decreased.  There are no signs 
indicative of pulmonary edema.  No pneumonia.  Stable correct 
alignment of the sternal wires.   
___, MD, PhD electronically signed ___ 
11:05 AM 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted 1 day before surgery for cardiac catheterization that 
reveal no significant coronary disease. He remained 
hemodynamically stable overnight and was taken to the operating 
room on ___. He underwent aortic and mitral valve 
replacements. Please see operative note for full details. In 
summary he had: Aortic valve replacement 21 mm ___ 
___ mechanical valve, and Mitral valve replacement, 27 mm ___. 
___ mechanical valve. He was transfused 
platlets, FFPs and PRBCs intraoperatively to correct 
coagulopathy. He tolerated the procedure well and was 
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and 
invasive monitoring. On the morning of POD1 he weaned from 
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He was 
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta blocker was 
initiated and he was diuresed toward his preoperative weight. 
Coumadin was initiated for anticoagulation of dual mechanical 
valves. He had acute blood loss anemia and was transfused PRBCs. 
He remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the 
telemetry floor for further recovery.  All tubes, lines, and 
drains were removed per cardiac surgery protocols without 
complication. Once on the stepdown floor he worked with nursing 
and was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance 
with strength and mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 8 he 
was ambulating freely, the wound was healing, and pain was 
controlled with oral analgesics. He was discharged home with 
visiting nurses in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
