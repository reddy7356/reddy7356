IMAGING:
==========
CTA chest and abdomen (___):
IMPRESSION: 
1. Dilated sigmoid colon, with a narrowing in the distal sigmoid 
colon 
measuring 2.6 cm.  This is improved compared to prior CT, 
previously measuring 9 mm.  No evidence of volvulus. 
2. No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism. 
3. Diffuse parenchymal opacities are new compared to prior CT on 
the ___.  This could reflect an infectious process or 
edema. 
4. A possible hypodense lesion in the pancreatic head is not as 
well 
appreciated on today's exam.  Pancreatic ductal dilation is 
unchanged. 
5. The remainder of the exam is unchanged, including extensive 
venous thrombi, a migrated IVC filter, intra and extrahepatic 
biliary duct dilation, and cholelithiasis without evidence of 
acute cholecystitis. 

ECHO (___):
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses 
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, 
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left 
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The 
estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
ascending aorta appeared dilated but the image quality was 
limited and no aneurysm was seen on the ___ CTA of the chest. 
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular chamber size with 
hyperdynamic systolic function. Normal right ventricular chamber 
size and systolic function. Moderate pulmonary artery 
hypertension.

KUB (___):
FINDINGS:    
There are no abnormally dilated loops of small bowel.  Improved 
decompression of the sigmoid colon. There is no free 
intraperitoneal air. 
Osseous structures are unremarkable. IVC filter is intact.  
Unchanged, numerous pelvic phleboliths.  Rectal tube tip is now 
at a lower position within the sigmoid colon.   
IMPRESSION:    
Improved decompression of the sigmoid colon.   

CXR (___):
FINDINGS:   
A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in position compared to the 
prior study.  The patient is somewhat rotated.  Lung volumes are 
within normal limits.  Patchy airspace opacities are noted at 
the left lung base, better appreciated on the CT chest.  No 
pleural effusion seen.  No pneumothorax seen.   
IMPRESSION:   
Patchy opacities of the left lung base better evaluated on the 
CT chest from the prior day.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of hemorrhagic 
CVA ___ R MCA aneurysm s/p R craniotomy and clipping (___) c/b 
L hemiplegia, s/p trach and PEG on seizure prophylaxis, hx of 
DVT/PE s/p IVC filter, s/p recent TAH-BSO ___, who presented to 
OSH with abdominal pain and was found to have colonic distension 
and was transferred to ___ ICU for hypoxia. She was found to 
have sigmoid volvulus which was treated by laparoscopic sigmoid 
colectomy and colostomy (___). Her course was complicated by 
bleeding from ostomy bag, pseudomonas pneumonia, UTI, and 
findings of ovarian vein thrombosis now on warfarin for 
discharge. She was also found to be intermittently 
encephalopathic throughout the hospital course with concern for 
new intracranial process but brain imaging remained unchanged. 
Mental status improved prior to discharge. She was also found to 
be hypercalcemic with elevated PTH levels suggestive of primary 
hyperparathyroidism, and was seen by endocrine who recommended 
increased fluid flushes and switching to a different tube feed 
with less calcium. She improved mentally throughout the hospital 
stay and had good osteomy output with no bleeding by discharge. 

Active Issues:

# Bilateral ovarian vein thrombosis with history of PE/DVT: She 
was found to have bilateral ovarian vein thromboses on imaging, 
likely related to her recent TAH/BSO. IVC filter was noted to be 
malpositioned. ___ was consulted and did not feel that there was 
need for repositioning for filter. She was managed on a heparin 
drip for new ovarian vein thromboses and transitioned to 
warfarin 5 mg daily for discharge. She will follow up with her 
PCP ___ will manage her warfarin dosing. Patient 
discharged on script for enoxaparin, in case needed for bridging 
therapy

# Sigmoid volvulus s/p colectomy with colostomy: Patient was 
found to have a sigmoid volvulus on KUB. She was evaluated by GI 
who performed a flexible sigmoidoscopy with decompression and 
placed a rectal tube. She then underwent a sigmoidectomy for 
definitive management with colostomy formation. She initially 
had small amounts of bleeding from the ostomy which resolved.

# E. coli urinary tract infection: Urine culture grew E. coli, 
which was treated with cefepime. The patient also had a Urine 
culture drawn on ___ which grew Klebsiella, although at that 
point she was asymptomatic, does not have an elevated WBC count, 
and has not had other signs of ongoing infection so we feel that 
this is most likely representative of her being colonized by 
this bacteria.

# Ill-defined pancreatic mass: CT incidentally noted an 
ill-defined pancreatic mass associated with moderate 
intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and 
dilation of the pancreatic duct. This should be followed up as 
an outpatient.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure with pseudomonas pneumonia: 
Patient underwent a bronchoscopy and BAL grew GNRs, which 
speciated to Pseudomonas. She was initially placed on broad 
spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/cefepime/levofloxacin) but this 
was narrowed to cefepime when BAL grew pseudomonas. Antibiotics 
finished. Required ventilator for one day but eventually changed 
back to trach mask, and saturating well on discharge.

#Hyperparathyroidism/Hypercalcemia: Seen by endocrine team, who 
felt that this was likely primary hyperparathyroidism but that 
her calcium levels were not high enough to explain the 
intermittent alterations in her mental status. They recommended 
gentle increasing of flushes and low calcium diet. Her calcium 
did improve slightly before discharge. She will be seen by 
Endocrine as an outpatient.

#RLE deep tissue injury: Pt developed bruising of her right calf 
likely related to PAS stocking use initially. Wound care saw the 
patient and weight distribution of the leg was recommended.

#Anemia: Pt came in with hgb 10.3, which dropped in the 8 range 
after surgery and remained there throughout. Iron studies 
indicated Anemia of chronic disease. Lab draws during 
complicated and prolonged hospital course likely contributed. 

#Peripheral edema: She was found to have 2+ pitting edema 
throughout the hospital course, likely in the setting of low 
albumin. Trial of diuresis resulted in hypotension, so was not 
further pursued.

Chronic issues:
======================================================= 
# H/o hemorrhagic CVA in ___, s/p right craniotomy and R MCA 
clipping with residual left sided hemiplegia, s/p trach and PEG: 
She was continued on depakote and keppra for seizure 
prophylaxis. She continued to use her helmet from home 
intermittently as she does not like how it fits. 
# Hypertension: Held off on BP meds on discharge as she had 
intermittent hypotension while admitted and was up to SBP 
130's-140's on discharge.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Atorvastatin 20mg daily. 
# Depression/Anxiety: Continued Citalopram 20mg daily. 
#Hyperthyroidism: Continued on Methimazole

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
===================== 
# Pancreatic mass: ill-defined, incidental finding on CT imaging 
- will need imaging follow up 
# Ms. ___ need her INR's checked and warfarin dosing 
adjusted by Dr. ___. Next INR check for ___
#Will give prescription for Enoxaparin in case pt is 
subtherapeutic and ___ clinic needs to bridge her back to 
therapeutic range.
#The patient's helmet should be worn at all times but she does 
not like how it fits so only wore it intermittently. Please 
consider refitting helmet for her.
#The patient was bridged to Warfarin with Lovenox. As her INR 
was therapeutic for three days prior to discharge, we held off 
on Lovenox for discharge. She will get a prescription for 
Lovenox in case her INR is subtherapeutic and needs new bridging
#Follow up with endocrine for new diagnosis of primary 
hyperparathyroidism
#Amlodipine and labetalol was discontinued due to low BP. SBP 
stable around 120s to 140s prior to discharge. Follow up with 
PCP and consider ___ if necessary.

The left hand is warm and well perfused, with a 2+ radial pulse 
and brisk capillary refill in all the fingers
Sensation is intact to the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. 
Unable to assess motor function secondary to resultant 
hemiparesis from a prior CVA. Patient however is able to move 
the small finger.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ___ clinic and was 
evaluated by Dr. ___. The patient was found to have 
a left distal forearm/wrist mass, which was previously biopsed 
and found to be a Schwannoma. The patient was admitted through 
the day surgery program at ___ 
for an excision of this left distal forearm mass. She was taken 
to the operating room for this procedure on ___. She 
tolerated the procedure well (for full details, please see the 
separately dictated operative report). Te was then taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after recovery from 
anesthesia was transferred to the floor.  The patient was 
initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, and
