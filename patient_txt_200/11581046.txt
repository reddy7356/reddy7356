Brief Hospital Course:
Patient Summary for Admission:
===============================
Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ PMHx HIV, DVT, and T2DM 
on metformin who presented with blood sugars elevated to 400 
without evidence of acidosis. There was no clear trigger 
identified for this marked hyperglycemia. Her insulin was 
titrated with the aid of the ___ diabetes team and once 
consistently under 300 patient felt safe to be discharged ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Hyperglycemia
#T2DM: Prior to admission patient's A1c 10.8 suggesting likely 
elevated blood glucose for some time. However unclear trigger 
for acute elevation of blood glucose prior to admission. On 
presentation to the emergency room, BS >400 with anion gap of 
23. She notably did not have evidence of acidemia. She was 
initially fluid resuscitated with 3L of ___ Diabetes team 
consulted for titration of insulin regimen. Regarding trigger 
for hyperglycemia, an infectious work up including blood, urine 
and chest xray was pursued and negative. There were no new 
medications initiated prior to this admission. Initial 
leukocytosis was likely reactive. Prior to discharge patient 
received insulin teaching. She was discharged on 40 units of 
glargine with Humalog sliding scale (discharged with basaglar 
for insurance reasons). She was provided with strict return 
precautions for her blood sugar level. 

#Difficulty swallowing: Patient reports some discomfort with 
swallowing. Not clear this is dysphagia, but oral exam without 
ulceration or posterior plaques noted. Would be at increased 
risk of ___ esophagitis in setting of HIV. Outpatient ID 
provider notified of admission. Consider EGD as outpatient. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
===============
#HIV: Continue home Triumeq (small risk of hyperglycemia with 
this medication, however will notify outpatient ID specialist of 
admission to facilitate further discussions).

#Hx DVT: Thought to be provoked from OCP use. Uses lovenox prior 
to airplane travel.

#HTN: HCTZ held while inatient in setting of normotension.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
Pending labs at discharge: Blood cultures
[] Given ongoing titration of insulin, patient scheduled with 
the ___ team ##
[] Given ongoing hyperglycemia, she was discharged with the 
following red flag blood sugar parameters
- If your blood sugars is >450 and you feel abdominal pain, 
nausea/vomiting please call the above number.
- If your blood sugar is <100 or you are feeling shaking, 
sweating or light headed please call ___, take a glucose 
tablet and eat something with sugar. This value is too low. 
[] ___ held on discharge given stable blood pressure while 
inpatient. If patient hypertensive as outpatient would consider 
ACEi therapy in setting of diabetes diagnosis.
[] Patient reporting some dysphagia like symptoms, would 
consider outpatient EGD to rule out ___ esophagitis.
[] As a part of new Type 2 DM diagnosis will need outpatient 
optometry evaluation.
*of note for outpatient providers, transitioned for glargine 
inpatient to basaglar pens given insurance preference. 
Additionally she will require pens for insulin delivery due to 
poor eye sight.
