Chief Complaint:
concern for mast cell activation syndrome 
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture (___)

 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ female with h/o carcinoid tumor of the
right lung s/p lobectomy, who presents with diffuse burning 
nerve
pain, poor sensation, flushing, abnormal vaginal bleeding and
significant concern for mast cell activation syndrome which she
feels will be responsive to IVIG (previously administered for
presumed autoimmune autonomic neuropathy as below). She is seen
in the room with her fiancé who is a retired ___ medicine
___. History is limited as patient's thought process is
very circumstantial and tangential.

Per patient, ___ years ago she was initiated on Nystatin for 
oral
thrush after which she began having diffuse nerve pain, rash,
vaginal bleeding, chills, tachycardia and urinary/GI symptoms.
This improved transiently with antihistamines. She brought this
to the attention of her primary care provider who, after finding
no clear underlying etiology for her prolonged symptoms, 
referred
her for psychiatric hospitalization due to patient's request for
closer monitoring of her symptoms. She was hosptalized on
multiple occasions and initiated on antipsychotics for presumed
delisional disorder. She was also seen by neurology during this
time who initiated weekly IVIG for presumed autoimmune autonomic
neuropathy though testing was not consistent with this 
diagnosis.
She felt improved on this and says her symptoms went into
remission for about a year.

She notes that approximately 2 months ago, around when she was
prescribed flexeril for sleep, she experienced recurrence of
symptoms, with facial flushing, diffuse burning pain,
intermittent swelling of her hands, anhidrosis, poor bowel and
bladder sensation, urinary retention, and constipation. She also
feels intermittently confused. She was seen at ___ recently (discharge date: ___ for similar
complaints. At ___, extensive workup for mast cell 
activation
syndrome was initiated, with several tests still pending. She 
was
seen by allergy/immunology who noted low suspicion for mast cell
activation syndrome given atypical presentation and multiple
negative tryptase tests. However, given inability to completely
exclude diagnosis and patient insistence on treatment,
allergy/immunology recommended antihistamine regimen along with
possible therapeutic trial of cromolyn. Per review of ___
records, primary team discussed possible contribution of
anticholinergic medications to presentation and psychiatry
proposed possibility of somatic symptom disorder; however 
patient
was resistent to these proposed etiologies to her illness and
requested transfer to ___ ED, which was done. She was seen in
the ED yesterday, discharged home, and represented today with 
the
same symptoms. Of note, over the past ___ weeks patient has
stopped taking most of her prescribed medications due to concern
that they are contributing to her mast cell activation syndrome.
She stopped taking her psychiatric medications on ___ per ___
records.

In the ED, vitals were: T: 98.4 HR 96 BP 140/84 RR 16 99% on RA

Exam notable for disheveled appearance, ruddy complexion, slight
right eye ptosis, tachycardia, neurologic exam without focal
deficits. Intermittent AMS with disorientation.

Moderate blood on UA. 

Studies:
CT Head w/o contrast: no evidence of acute intracranial
abnormality

bowel obstruction or free intraperitoneal air.

They were given: 
- diphenhydramine 25 mg
- Gabapentin 300 mg
- Lorazepam 2 mg
- 1 L IVF

Upon arrival to the floor, she is alert and oriented. However,
she is tangential and circumferential in her thought process. 
She
reiterates the above history and notes that she is concerned
regarding mast cell activation syndrome and her vaginal 
bleeding.
She says that she does not have regular periods. Of note, she
does state she recently modified her home hormone regimen. She
requests IVIG, an LP, steroids. She shows a video *she filmed of
herself* 2 days ago after taking flexeril with eyes rolling back
and automatisms with lip smacking and moaning.

complex 

[] Continue taking Risperdal and Ativan for insomnia until 
follow up with Dr. ___.

[ ] Consider establishment in ___ clinic as an outpatient.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==============
# Tachycardia
# Anticholinergic symptoms
# Lancinating pains
Patient hadrecent admission to ___ ___ for the same symptoms 
including diffuse burning pain, painful rashes, severe 
constipation, urinary retention, facial flushing. She was seen 
by allergy and neurology and ultimately it was felt that
ongoing delusional disorder was exacerbating her symptoms. 
Allergy did not think that she met criteria for mast cell 
disease and follow up was arranged with Dr. ___ in mast 
cell clinic. She was given prednisone during her course but the 
team felt that there was no indication for further steroids. She 
was also given
cetirizine, Benadryl, montelukast, and cromolyn. She refused to 
be seen by psychiatry. These symptoms have been episodically 
presented since ___ when she was exposed to nystatin for 
oral candidiasis. Tryptase was rechecked here and once again 
within normal limits. The neurology team was consulted and a 
panel of tests were sent including B12, B6, hemoglobin A1c, TSH, 
Lyme, Sjogren's antibodies, rheumatoid factor, urine 
porphobilinogen which were all normal. Due to patient concern 
about positive syphilis antibody test at ___ office, treponemal 
antibody was sent which returned positive. RPR was negative, but 
due to concern for possible neurosyphilis as the cause of her 
symptoms she received an LP. CSF VDRL was negative. During this 
admission, she had a number of self-described "inflammatory 
attacks" that involved feelings of chest pain, flushing, burning 
pains all over, and which she described as not being able to 
take a full breath of air. During these episodes she remained 
vitally stable apart from her tachycardia which is chronic. Labs 
drawn throughout this admission were otherwise unremarkable. She 
also complained of constipation and urinary retention. She was 
given bowel regimen and post void residuals were measured by 
bladder scan. She was continued on several home medications for 
her allergic/immunologic symptoms including antihistamines.

# Encephalopathy
# Mania
Patient was noted to be confused in the emergency department and 
showing signs of mania including lack of sleep and perseveration 
on her symptoms. This was thought possibly secondary to 
receiving Ativan in the emergency department during morning 
hours. Her mood symptoms and perseveration improved during the 
course of the hospitalization and it was determined that she 
would be safe to be discharged home with close psychiatric 
follow-up.

# Insomnia
The patient endorsed not sleeping for up to 2 weeks. Tried 
giving Seroquel and haloperidol with Ativan without success. 
Patient did respond to Risperdal and was discharged on 1.5 mg 
nightly and 0.5 mg Ativan nightly, with 0.5 mg Risperdal bid prn 
for insomnia/distressing symptoms per psychiatry 
recommendations.

#Abnormal uterine bleeding 
Patient noting abnormal uterine bleeding with patient denying 
ongoing menstruation. Pt endorsed ongoing symptoms but never 
witnessed while in house

syndrome and other rare diseases as the cause of your symptoms. 
Your inflammatory markers were normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
# ___ ulcer: patient had burning "rectal pain" with BMs on 
___, associated with "swollen glands" in her neck and 
subjective fevers (but no measured fever) on ___ burning 
rectal pain worsened on ___ and patient had her partner examine 
her anus and ___ region. They found a small ~3 mm 
ulcerating erythematous lesion in the area she was having pain 
(showed us a photograph of the lesion). At which point she 
started taking Valtrex (she has hx of labial herpes and oral 
herpes for which she has standing Rx for PRN valacyclovir), 
however she only took 1 or 2 doses prior to presenting to the 
hospital with severe sore throat, chills, and subjective fever 
with temperature measured at 99.4 F at home.  On examination of 
her genital & anal regions, she had no skin or mucous membrane 
ulcers, lesions, or pustules, so we were not able to send an HSV 
swab to confirm Dx of HSV recurrence.  We will treat empirically 
for 5 days with valacyclovir on discharge given her recent oral 
herpetic lesions (1 week ago) and the characteristic appearance 
of the ___ lesion (2 days ago) even though neither is 
currently present on exam, particularly given her sore throat & 
odynophagia could represent an esophageal HSV lesion (though her 
posterior oropharynx appeared normal on inspection).

# Sore throat / myalgias / fevers / chills: ___ developed 
"swollen glands" in her neck in setting of her partner, ___, 
having just recently had sore throat and URI-type symptoms. She 
was concerned she might be catching whatever he had. On ___, 
sore throat began and she had subjective fevers (but measured 
temperature was normal). On ___, sore throat not bothering her 
much, but she did have some lethargy. On ___, she got her 
scheduled IVIG and noted that her sore throat became severe. She 
developed sneezing, runny nose, and sputum production from the 
nose. On ___ she developed chills and measured her temperature 
at 99.4 and presented to the ___ ED. On presentation to the 
emergency department she had tachycardia into the 120s and her 
first temperature was 99.4. Her Tmax in the ED was 100.2. Her 
CXR was not suggestive of PNA and her UA was clean. Blood Cx 
from ED were NGTD. She presented to the medical floor on the 
morning of ___ and on initial evaluation was feeling 
significantly better, reporting that her chills and muscle aches 
were improving, but that her sore throat was worsening. She 
reported that Tylenol and ibuprofen in the ED were particularly 
helpful for her pain. On the medical floor she was given a trial 
of symptomatic treatment with Maalox/lido solution + cepacol 
lozenges + Tylenol + ibuprofen.  She was able to tolerate a 
regular diet on the day of discharge without severe odynophagia. 
 The patient felt that her constellation of symptoms was most 
likely due to a viral URI, and we agree.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital with sore throat, fever, 
muscle aches, malaise, and a painful ___ ulcer.  You had 
labs checked, cultures drawn, and a chest X-ray performed.  
There is no clear evidence for a bacterial infection that would 
require antibiotics. We suspect your symptoms were due to a 
viral illness, which is resolving on its own.  The ___ 
ulcer had resolved by the time you were examined here in the 
hospital, so we were unable to send a swab to the lab to test 
for HSV (herpes simplex virus) to definitively assess if you 
were having a herpes flare; but we think it is a good idea to 
treat as if this is in fact an HSV flare with a total of 5 days 
of valacyclovir.  We recommend that you follow-up with your 
primary care physician in the next ___ weeks to assess for 
resolution of your symptoms.

We wish you the best.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Medicine Team
