Brief Hospital Course:
Information for Outpatient Providers: ___ man with a h/o EtOH 
cirrhosis c/b esophageal varices, undergoing serial band 
ligation (most recent ___ and recurrent soft tissue 
infections (h/o MRSA), who presented for outpatient EGD /colon 
on ___, referred to ED for LLE wounds concerning for 
cellulitis. Hospital course complicated by intermittent fevers 
while on broad spectrum antibiotics and acute kidney injury.

# Cellulitis
Tender erythematous, tender swelling up to ___ of left lower 
extremity, with slight leukocytosis (10.9). Skin on shins were 
covered with multiple excoriated lesions with broken skin. 
Likely due to venous insufficiency, poor wound healing (T2DM), 
and broken skin due to scratching and chronic itch. Patient was 
treated with vancomycin for 7 days with great improvement ___ 
- ___. Vancomycin was discontinued on ___ out of concern for 
drug-induced fever, and patient was transitioned to doxycycline 
on ___ to complete a 14 day course on ___.
Cellulitis improved while on antibiotics, with significant 
reductions in erythema, warmth, and tenderness. Initial 
leukocytosis resolved after day 1 of treatment and has remained 
normal.

# Hypoxia: Patient developed some shortness of breath and 
hypoxia on ___, requiring intermittent supplemental oxygen (1L) 
and nebulizer treatments, with patient complaining of chest 
tightness and dyspnea, particularly in the setting of receiving 
supplemental albumin. CXR was initially significant for lower 
right lobe consolidation vs. effusion, and pulmonary edema. He 
was given IV Lasix and briefly treated with vancomycin, 
ceftazidine, and flagyl, until repeat CXR showed resolution of 
the consolidation most consistent with pulmonary edema/effusion 
on ___. Patient was breathing comfortably on room air by ___. 

# Fever - Patient spiking intermittent fevers every day since 
___. Antibiotics were broaded vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and 
flagyl, with repeat CXR initially concerning for 
hospital-acquired PNA. However, persistent, intermittent fevers 
continued despite broad antibiotic coverage. Resolution of 
radiographic signs with diuresis made a fever due to PNA less 
likely. Out of concern for drug reaction causing fever (patient 
noted a reaction to vancomycin), all antibiotics were 
discontinued on ___ and doxycycline was started on ___. His 
fevers resolved and vancomycin was added to him adverse reaction 
list. 

# Right chest wall and RUQ pain: Most likely costocondritis, as 
very tender to palpation. No evidence of rib fractures on CT. No 
tachycardia or hypoxia to suggest PE. Treated with Tylenol, 
lidocaine patch. At time of discharge this pain had resolved. 

# ___: Patient presented with a Cr of 1.3 that has progressively 
trended up to 2.0 on ___. Patient had a likely prerenal iso of 
NPO for EGD/Colonoscopy, but ___ did not respond to fluid 
resuscitation with 25% albumin, nor did it improve with 
diruesis. Muddy brown fragements possibly seen on urine 
sediment. Low urine chloride suggesting dehydration. Nephrology 
consulted on ___ and did not have further recommendations since 
his creatinine had improved to 1.6 then 1.5 at time of 
discharge. His spironolactone was held in the setting ___ 
with potassium of 5.0. Recommend repeat labs in one week prior 
to resumption of his spironolactone. 

# Diarrhea. Has intermittent diarrhea at baseline has complained 
of this during hospital stay. C. diff negative. Stool O+P and 
cultures also negative. Possibly secondary to antibiotics and 
resolved by the time of discharge.

# Esophageal varices, s/p banding ___: patient was continued 
on his home pantoprazole and sucralfate. Propranolol was reduced 
to BID given low blood pressures initially and increased back to 
TID at time of discharge. He will continue his sucralfate until 
he completes a 2 week course on ___.

# HTN: patient's Enalapril 10mg BID was held on admission and 
discharge secondary to systolic BP 100-110.

IMAGING:
======================
___ ABDOMINAL U/S: 
Patent hepatic vasculature.  No focal lesions, within the limits 
of the examination.

___ CXR:
There is no consolidation.  There are no pleural effusions.  The 
heart is normal in size.  The aorta is atherosclerotic.  The 
trachea is midline.  The visualized osseous structures are 
unremarkable.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:
================
___ hx decompensated cirrhosis (child ___ B; decompensated with 
portal hypertension, bleeding from esophageal varices status 
post banding, hepatic encephalopathy and volume overload 
presenting with LLE pain, swelling and redness concerning for 
cellulitis. 

ACTIVE ISSUES:
================
# LLE SWELLING and 
# ?CELLULITIS:
Patient p/w worsening LLE pain, swelling, and redness with 
blistering. He was given 40mg IV Lasix for two days in addition 
to his spironolactone, and then transitioned back to his home 
dose of Lasix 40mg qd with an increase in his spironolactone 
from 50mg to 100mg daily. His exam was concerning for possible 
cellulitis with MRSA involvement (history of MRSA skin 
infections) given that pt had some weeping blisters and has had 
MRSA skin infections in the past. However, he also has 
chronic-looking skin changes that may indicate underlying venous 
stasis changes. He was treated with vancomycin in-house, to 
improvement of his erythema. He was continued on doxycycline BID 
for a total of a 7-day course of antimicrobial therapy. His 
final day of therapy will be ___.

# ETOH CIRRHOSIS:
Child's ___ B, complicated by bleeding varices, hepatic 
encephalopathy, and volume overload. Possibly due to dietary 
indiscretion at home (Pt has his wife's family cooking for them 
oftentimes, and it is generally salty food). Nutrition consulted 
and provided recommendations for low salt intake. His edema 
improved after 2 doses of active diuresis with 40mg IV 
furosemide + albumin. He was transitioned to an oral diuretic 
regimen of 40mg furosemide/100mg spironolactone (increased from 
50mg spironolactone that he had previously been on).
- Continued on home propranolol for variceal bleed PPx
- Continued on home HE regimen

# DIARRHEA:
Pt with some complaints of on and off diarrhea for several 
months. It was not bothersome during his hospital stay, so a C. 
diff was not checked.

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES:
===========================
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:
- Home antihypertensives as below
- Consider starting a statin as outpatient (has possibly not 
been on it due to cirrhosis, but if he has not had adverse 
reactions likely could tolerate a low to moderate intensity 
statin).

# HISTORY OF DIABETES:
- Followed by ___ Associates
- ___ = 7.8
- D/c on home insulin regimen, no changes made:
U-500 insulin sliding scale (no standing insulin)
Pre-meal blood sugar, units 
(B = breakfast, D = dinner)

# SEIZURE DISORDER:
- Home lamotrigine

# COPD:
- Home Prozac and aricept

# ANEMIA, BASELINE:
- Home iron supplements

# GERD:
- Home pantoprazole
