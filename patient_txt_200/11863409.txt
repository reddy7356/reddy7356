Confusion and hypotension
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of prostate 
cancer
s/p XRT with metastatic osseus recurrence involving spine and 
prostatic mass invading bladder on Lupron and Xytiga, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, who presents with worsening 
confusion and hypotension. He states that he has had chills, 
dyspnea, and abdominal pain. Denies black or bloody stools.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6, HR 100, BP 81/48, RR 20, 
and O2 93% on RA. On repeat measurement, patient remained 
hypotensive with SBP 70-80s, and had worsening tachypnea ranging 
from ___. Exam was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness 
and distention and has baseline urinary incontinence. He also 
had marked LLE swelling. Labs were notable for WBC of 4.8 with 
27 bands, anemia with H/H 9.5/28.3, proBNP 1579, anion gap of 
22, and a lactate of 6.3 with VBP 7.42/38/20. UA showed RBC > 
182, WBC >182, small leuk, and neg nitrite. CT Head was 
remarkable for left temporal mass measuring 2.8x1.9cm with 
adjacent vasogenic edema that is new since ___. CT A/P 
was revealing for 4mm left ureteral stone with moderate left 
hydroureteronephrosis, unchanged in degree since ___, 
but with possibility of forniceal rupture. Diffuse thickening of 
the posterior and left lateral urinary bladder wall is 
concerning for malignancy. Patient was given 2L NS, 2 doses of 
vancomycin and zosyn. Patient was not responsive to 2L fluid 
bolus and was started on norepinephrine gtt at 0.1, uptitrated 
to 0.18 mcg/kg. Repeat lactate was 1.8 Neurosurgery was 
consulted and they will defer active management until evaluated 
by neurooncology. Urology was also consulted and patient was 
sent for percutaneous nephrostomy for likely infected stone.

MD was called to ___ suite for tachycardia (160s-170s) and 
hypotension (MAPs ___. He received 1 L LR, was brought up to 
the MICU where he was diffusely wheezing + anesthesia was called 
to intubate him. Following intubation, we pushed 6 + 12 of 
adenosine for HRs in 160s-170s. Following adensosine, his HR 
normal dec to 110s and an EKG was sinus tachycardia. At 
approximately 1030 pm, his BP continued to drop, a second L of 
LR was given and vasopressin was added. We provided stress dose 
steroids.

SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY. 
- Scattered highly atypical cells, present in a background of 
blood, fibrinous debris, and benign-appearing urothelial cells.
The findings are suspicious for bladder involvement by prostate 
cancer. If clinically indicated, cystoscopy with biopsy could be 
considered for further characterization of the atypical cells. 
Clinical and radiologic correlation is advised.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was a ___ year old male with history of prostate cancer 
s/p XRT with metastatic ossues recurrence and bladder 
involvement, who presented with confusion, chills and abdominal 
pain in septic shock, found to have obstructing left ureteral 
stone with moderate hyproutereronephrosis and new calvarial met 
with temporal lobe compression.  On admission he received a left 
percutaneous nephrostomy, which decompressed his hydronephrosis 
and was treated for pyelonephritis ___ obstructing urothelial 
stone.  His multiple bone mets were assessed with MRI and CT, 
demonstrating worsening spinal lesions and new calvarial 
metastasis thought to be causing worsening mental status.  He 
was intubated for the initial PCN procedure in the setting of 
shock, and was unable to be extubated during his hospitalization 
due to alteration of mental status and neurogenic breathing 
patterns with prolonged periods of apnea interspersed with brief 
breathing episodes of ___ breaths.  

Goals of care were discussed with his family, who elected to 
extubate with DNI status ___ in the setting of worsening 
metastatic disease and unchanged critical clinical condition.  
He was made comfort measures only and expired at 1308 on 
___.

MRI C/T/L spine
1. Study is moderately degraded by motion and limited to the 
lack
of administration of intravenous contrast.  Please note that 
this is
an incomplete examination without acquisition of post-contrast 
sequences as patient could not tolerate further imaging. 
2. Significant progression of osseous metastatic disease, as 
described, with both new and enlarging lesions, involving the 
cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, left posterior first rib, 
and bilateral iliac bones.  Bony expansion from a metastatic 
lesions are seen at multiple levels, with suggestion of extra 
cortical soft tissue extension at the L5 level producing mild 
spinal canal narrowing and severe neural foraminal narrowing at 
the right L5-S1 level with focal encasement of the exiting right 
L5 nerve root.  Additional areas of extra cortical soft tissue 
extension are possible, though difficult to characterize given 
lack of intravenous contrast. 
3. New mild pathologic superior endplate compression fracture of 
the L2 vertebral body. 
4. Interval decrease in size of a 16 x 5 mm mildly expansile 
intramedullary spinal cord lesion at the level of T6.

root.
3. No new osseous lesions are seen when compared with the recent 
study from ___.
4. Unchanged mild L2 superior endplate compression deformity, 
new from ___.
5. Moderate to severe left-sided hydronephrosis, stable from ___.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old male with past medical history of prostate 
cancer, hypertension, recent MRI ___ concerning for 
metastatic disease without clear follow-up, admitted ___ 
with signs of rapidly progressing metastatic disease 

# Metastatic Prostate Cancer - Patient with recent history of 
prior imaging from ___ and ___ that had been concerning 
for progressing malignancy, but who had not had follow-up 
appointments for additional workup, who was referred for 
admission with imaging demonstrating significant progression of 
malignancy.  This included significant osseous burden of disease 
of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, as well as ribs, iliac 
bones.  Patient was seen by heme/onc service and underwent 
biopsy of anterior chest wall mass that showed metastatic 
prostate cancer.  He was started on IM lupron and bicalutamide.  
He was seen by radiation oncology and urology as below. 

# Acute L2 compression 
# Metastases to Vertebrae
On admission imaging, patient was found to have L2 compression 
fracture and well as spinal cord lesion at T6. MRI quality was 
degraded by motion and by early termination prior to 
post-contrast images.  Patient was seen by spine service who 
felt there were no concerning features on patients exam to 
suggest cord compression.  He was fitted for TLSO brace and was 
started on standing Tylenol with prn Oxycodone.  He was seen by 
radiation oncology and underwent repeat MRI that showed which 
showed stable metastatic spinal lesions.  He underwent 5 total 
fractions of radiation treatment prior to discharge.

# L Hydronephrosis and Hydroureter 
# Bladder Mass
Patient found to have admission imaging with L hydronephrosis 
and hydroureter as well as a suspected infiltrating bladder 
mass.  He was seen by urology service who, given stable 
creatinine, recommended non urgent cystoscopy with transurethral 
bladder tumor resection and ureteral stenting.  He was scheduled 
for follow-up post-discharge.

# History of Prostate Cancer - Continued doxazosin and 
oxybutynin

# Hypertension - Continued amlodipine, metoprolol

# Peripheral Vascular Disease - Continued home statin
