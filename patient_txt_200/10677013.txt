History of Present Illness:
Mr ___ is a ___ with h/o ETOH abuse, alcoholic pancreatitis, 
CAD who presented to ___ with on day of 
n/v/abd pain and found to have acute pancreatitis and ETOH 
withdrawal on ___. At the time of presentation his Lipase was 
___bd/pelvis showed mild peripancreatic edema and fluid 
infiltration in retroperitoneum. The patient was intially 
treated on the medicine service with IVF, analgesia and kept 
NPO. However, his course was complicated by Delirium tremens for 
which he was transferred to the critical care unit on ___. He 
was treated with dexmedetomide and IV lorazepam with 
improvement. At this time the patient is ___ days out from his 
last drink and maintained on IV lorazepam. The patient began to 
complain of increasing abdominal pain with note of increased 
abdominal girth and tenderness on exam. Repeat CT showed 
enlargement of the pancreas with circumferential peripancreatic 
fluid collection and enlarging collection in lesser sac and 
splenic hilium, as well as retroperitoneal fluid, and findings 
suggestive of pancreatic necrosis. In addition, the patient has 
been persistently febrile over the past few days with maximum 
temp of 102 with persistant leukocytosis (wbc 15K with 30% 
bands). His cultures prior to transfer were negative to date 
other than CDIFF. He was found to have postive CDIFF PCR and was 
started on IV flagyl. Planned to start PO vancomycin but not 
administered prior to transfer. He has remained HD stable 
throughout his course with  BP 110s, HR in 90-100s, O2 stas 96% 
on 2L NC (dropping to 88% on RA), foley in place draining 
100-1500cc/hr on D51/2NS 20KCL at 75cc/hr. He has been kept NPO

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ with h/o ETOH abuse, pancreatitis, CAD who 
presented to ___ with acute pancreatitis on 
___ c/b ETOH withdrawal with DTs, transferred to the ___ MICU 
for further management of pancreatitis and delirium who has been 
managed conservatively.

ACUTE CARE 
# Acute Pancreatitis Patient with h/o pancreatitis likely 
secondary to ETOH abuse ___ 133). There was concern for 
pancreatic necrosis at OSH, however review of imaging here 
showed acute pancreatitis but no etiology of necrosis. Upon 
transfer from OSH, he was initially febrile with a mild 
leukocytosis, and this was attributed to possible cytokine 
release from pancreatitis. He was managed at OSH and at ___ 
with IVF, NPO and pain control, received tube feeds, this was 
subsequently stopped and Dobhoff was discontinued. He was then 
trialed on clear diet but had recurrence of pain, he was again 
NPO with IV dilaudid pain medications, and then diet was 
advanced and he was transitioned to PO dilaudid without any 
worsening of pain.  He was discharged on BRAT diet with very 
cautious advancement. 
 
# CDIFF colitis  - tested positive at OSH and given IV flagyl, 
but was started on PO vanc on ___ for ___t time of 
discharge, he was having formed stools.

# ETOH abuse/delirium tremens: Last drink over 2 weeks ago. 
Patient's course complicated by delirium tremens, he was started 
on Precedex and Lorazepam gtt at the OSH, this was tapered off 
and discontinued with radical improvement in mental status, 
which could indicated that benzo intoxication was a large 
contributor to his delirium. No signs of alcohol withdrawal.  He 
was started on thiamine, MVI, folic acid. Social work was 
consulted and he was felt to be pre-contemplative regarding 
cessation of alcohol. 
 
# Gout: R podogra, possibly some left foot metatarsal pain. 
Improved with treatment with Indomethacin 50mg TID for now and 
also Omeprazole to decrease risk of GIB (not preventative). At 
time of discharge, he had mild pain at R podogra but no pain on 
left foot.
  
# Anemia: Likely secondary to ETOH abuse. Mildly elevated LDH 
but haptoglobin is elevated, making hemolysis unlikely. OSH labs 
showed low iron, high ferritin (consistent with anemia of 
chronic disease). No evidence of bleeding.   

# Transaminitis-resolved, but initially was mild and consistent 
with alcohol-related liver disease.

# fungal infections: The patient endorsed crural candial 
infection and was treated with miconazole powder; he also had 
oral candidiasis and was treated with nystatin s/s

TRANSITIONS OF CARE

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of HTN, HLD, CAD 
s/p vfib arrest and ICD placement ___ and a history of 
polysubstance abuse who is being directly admitted from clinic 
with chest pain for consideration of catheterization, biomarkers 
were negative and CP resolved on nitro gtt, cath ___ showed 
essentially normal coronaries.  

#Coronaries.  His chest pain is atypical in that it has been 
continuous for 2 days, does not correlate strongly with 
exertion, and associated symptoms of DOE and diaphoresis have 
been only intermittent.  He does have a history of CAD, with a 
20% LAD lesion and occlusion at the apex noted in ___ which 
raises suspicion for ACS despite his atypical pain.  He was 
treated initially with 325mg aspirin, chewed, sublingual nitro 
x1, then started on a nitro gtt, heparin gtt, and metoprolol 
tartrate 25mg qid. No events were recorded on tele, and there 
have been no EKG changes. Trop has been <.01 x3.  Overnight 
continued nitro gtt, heparin gtt, daily ASA, BB, and CP resolved 
by AM.  Taken for cath ___ which showed essentially normal 
coronaries.
 
# PUMP:  Last ECHO showed regional LV systolic dysfunction 
consistent with past inferior infarction. Normal diastolic 
function. No significant valvular abnormality seen. Mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.   Hepatojugular reflux 
on exam also consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.  BB 
as above, started ACE after cath. 

Chronic issues:
# H/O alcohol abuse
-continue home vitamin supplementation including MV, folate, 
thiamine

Brief Hospital Course:

lumbar stenosis, L5-S1 disc bulge, and recent admission ___ 
for pancreatitis in the setting ETOH use p/w transient urinary 
incontinence, left arm and leg weakness, and chronic back pain.
.
# Left-sided weakness/urinary incontinence: Patient described 
being unable to move his left leg at all and having a very weak 
left arm. He also reported one episode of urinary incontinence 
(upon awaking) and asymmetric saddle sensation (see below). He 
denied any constitutional symptoms. He was evaluated by Ortho 
Spine and by Neurology. He was given a soft cervical collar for 
sleep. There was concern for stroke or spinal cord compression. 
He was started on dexamethasone. He was unable to have an MRI 
because of his AICD. He had a CT/CTA of his head, which revealed 
no evidence of an acute process. He also had a CT/CTA of his 
neck, which revealed some mild-to-moderate neural foraminal 
narrowing, but no fracture, abscess, or other acute process. His 
strength appeared to return rapidly such that at the time of 
admission he had 4+/5 strength in his left arm and ___ strength 
in left leg and by HD2 he demonstrated ___ arm strength and 
___ leg strength. His neurologic exam otherwise remained 
stable. His dexamethasone was stopped. He remained continent 
throughout the admission and his post void residuals were all 
normal. He had previously had a CT myelogram that was notable 
for an asymmetric disc bulge at L5-S1 possibly indenting 
traversing right S1 nerve root and spinal stenosis. Given the 
quick resolution of his symptoms, our concern for cord 
compression was low, so a CT myelogram was not performed. We 
think the most likely etiology of his short-lived weakness and 
incontinence was a transient ischemic attack. We stopped his 
tricor and started simvastatin; we continued his aspirin 81mg. 
He was seen by ___ who recommended outpatient ___.
.
# Asymmetric Saddle Sensation: Patient reported ~25% decreased 
sensation in his left ___ area. He had reasonable rectal 
tone and remained continent throughout the admission. Because 
his sensation was intact, cord compression was ruled unlikely. 
The decreased sensation may be due to to a small not-detected 
ischemic event or may be unrelated.
. 
# Abdominal pain: The patient report epigastric/LUQ discomfort 
and tenderness. He was recently admitted at ___ for 
pancreatitis and he believes this discomfort is consistent with 
his pancreatitis pain that is still resolving, but much 
improved. His lipase was normal. He also was recently infected 
with C. diff and completed treatment. He remained afebrile, had 
normal WBC count, and had no diarrhea. He actually was a little 
constipated at one point during his admission and had lower 
abdominal discomfort resolved following defectation. In terms of 
other etiologies, his LFTs were also normal. He was originally 
NPO and then his diet was advanced slowly without difficulty. 
His pain was well controlled on oxycodone ___ mg q6h.
.
# Back pain: The patient has a history of low back pain and 
tenderness most consistent with a muscular source s/p fall, and 
pain radiating down his left leg, likely explained by a 
documented L5-S1 disk bulge. Ortho Spine is planning a 
laminectomy. Throughout this admission his back pain was stable 
and he experienced none of the radiating pain. He should call 
Ortho Spine for follow-up and to schedule a lumbar-sacral 
laminectomy. 
.
# ETOH abuse: Patient has a significant alcohol history, which 
is likely responsible for his pancreatitis. He says his last 
drink was prior to his previous hospital admission (> 3 weeks 
ago). He developed no signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal 
and was continued on thiamine, MVI, and folate.
.
# CAD: He has an EF 50-55% and has had a Vfib arrest now s/p 
AICD. Discussed with PCP why ___ was stopped. He was 
continued on aspirin 81mg. He described a mild, short-lived 
chest discomfort without associated symptoms at one point during 
admission and his EKG showed no acute changes.
.
# Normocytic Anemia: His hematocrit remained stable. It is 
likely due to anemia of chronic disease versus multifactorial.
.
# Depression: The patient has a history of depression, but 
reports positive mood and had congruent affect throughout his 
admission. He was continued on his home citalopram and 
quetiapine.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Patient has hyperlipidemia and his trialed on 
many medications. He came in on tricor. We discussed his regimen 
with his PCP and on discharge we decided to switch him to 
simvastatin for secondary stroke prevention.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
1) We stopped his tricor and started low-dose simvastatin, which 
could be titrated up.
2) We provided him with a short course of oxycodone for pain 
management and discussed stopping ___ for now and then 
restarting when oxycodone is all done.
3) He should continue taking a baby aspirin for secondary 
prevention.
4) He was given a script for outpatient ___.
5) He should call Dr. ___ office to schedule 
follow-up and surgery.
6) He has a device check and appointment with Dr. ___ 
cardiologist
7) Patient should make an appointment with his PCP within one 
week.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,
It was a pleasure participating in your care here at ___. You 
came into the hospital because of abrupt onset left arm and leg 
weakness and one-time urinary incontinence. Your incontinence 
resolved and your weakness improved considerably during your 
stay. We performed a CT scan of your head and neck, as well as a 
CT scan of the vesseles in your head and neck. These scans 
showed no evidence of disease that could explain your symptoms, 
including cord compression, stroke, or infection. We think the 
most likely possibility is that you had a transient ischemic 
attack (or TIA), which is a mini-stroke. To help prevent future 
TIAs, we have started you on simvastatin and restarted your 
aspirin.

Medication changes:
- STOP taking tricor (you should not take this while taking 
simvastatin)
- START taking simvastatin 10 mg by mouth daily to help prevent 
TIAs/stroke
- CONTINUE taking a baby aspirin
- STOP taking ___
- START taking oxycodone ___ mg by mouth every six hours as 
needed for pain

Physical therapy saw you while you were here and recommend 
outpatient physical therapy.  We have written a prescription for 
this.

___ 07:35AM BLOOD Calcium-9.6 Phos-3.5 Mg-2.___ year old man with HTN, HL, CAD, and h/o cocaine abuse, 
transferred from an OSH after VFib arrest for ICD placement. 
.  
# S/p VFib arrest: Unclear precipitant, though the patient does 
admit to occasional cocaine use and has a significant ETOH 
history. ECHO showed mild global LV hypokinesis with LVEF 45%. 
He underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a 20% 
proximal LAD lesion, with total occlusion at the apex with good 
collaterals, so no stent was placed. He was transferred to ___ 
for ICD placement for secondary prevention of sudden death. The 
ICD was successfully placed without complication and he was 
continued on antibiotics (vancomycin then clindamycin) for 48 
hours afterward. He will follow up in the device clinic in 1 
week and will follow up with Dr. ___ at ___.
.
# CAD: Cath showed 20% proximal LAD lesion, with total occlusion 
at the apex with good collaterals, so no stent placed. We 
continued ASA 81mg daily and started metoprolol succinate 25mg 
daily. Lipid management as discussed below. 
.
# Pump: ECHO at OSH showed mild global LV hypokinesis with LVEF 
45%. He is currently euvolemic on exam and denies any symptoms 
of heart failure. We started lisinopril 5mg daily and metoprolol 
succinate 25mg daily.  
.
# Hypertension: The patient states that he has a history of HTN, 
though his blood pressure was well controlled during this 
admission and he was not on any blood pressure medications at 
home. We started metoprolol succinate and lisinopril as 
discussed above.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Chol 217, ___ 277, HDL 64, LDL 98. Considering 
his CAD he may benefit from initiation of statin therapy to 
lower LDL to less than 70.  
.
# GERD: Asymptomatic. Continued omeprazole 20mg daily.
