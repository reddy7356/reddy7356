have been slowly trending up, and most recently his bili and alk 
phos were elevated. Recent liver biopsies showed early recurrent 
HCV, and notably have not shown evidence of acute rejection. His 
immunosuppressants are being tapered down now that he is ___ 
months s/p transplant. Specifically, cellcept was discontinued 
at his clinic appointment on day of admission and his tacrolimus 
0.5mg was dropped from BID to daily on admission. CT chest 
performed on day of admission to eval for ___ mets showed a 
2.4cm right liver lobe lesion. He had subsequent MRI, as well as 
MRCP to evaluate his rising bilirubin, which showed no 
concerning liver lesion but pancreatic head cyst. On hospital 
day 2, he was started on ribavirin 200 qam and 400 qpm, as well 
as inteferon alfacon-1 15mcg qpm. The IFN was preceded by 1L IVF 
hydration and 500mg acetaminophen to decrease side effects, 
although he experienced headache, chills, fever and rigors 
following the first dose. Blood and urine cultures were sent due 
to the fevers, and showed no significant growth.

tapered off some of his immunosuppression as above. He was 
started on filgrastim SC 480mcg three times weekly, and his WBC 
and ANC increased and his ANC was approximately 2500 at time of 
d/c.
