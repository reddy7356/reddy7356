AP CHEST, 3:29 A.M. ON ___ 
  
HISTORY: A ___ woman with pneumonia and recent 
desaturation and 
tachycardia. 
  
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to ___: 
  
Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened to the point of early 
pulmonary 
edema, increasing the small right pleural effusion as well as 
vascular 
caliber. Heterogeneous opacification at both lung bases could be 
any 
combination of asymmetric edema, atelectasis, aspiration, and 
pneumonia. Left lower lobe atelectasis has worsened. No 
pneumothorax. The heart is 
moderately enlarged and the azygos vein is borderline distended.

76 142 78 ___ ___ presenting from ___, for acute worsening 
of mental status accompanied by chest pain and low BP with 
elevated WBC and temp at rehab concerning for new pneumonia.  
.  
# Pneumonia, possibly complicated by empyema: The patient was 
treated with cefepime, vancomycin, and levaquin for hospital 
acquired pneumonia.  Imaging also showed bilateral pleural 
effusions that were likely infected as well, since she failed to 
improve on antibiotics.  Given her clinical status and 
bilaterality of the fluid collections, it was determined that 
thoracenteses were too high of a risk for her and were deferred. 
 She intermittently desaturated, requiring high flow oxygen.  
These episodes were likely multifactorial, secondary to 
aspiration, continued pneumonia, and mucus plugging.  Though she 
was DNR/DNI on admission, further goals of care discussions 
later in her hospitalization indicated that the family wanted to 
focus on comfort.  After an acute aspiration episode, suctioning 
was attempted and IV morphine was pushed.  Ultimately, the 
patient had a respiratory arrest and passed away.  Family was at 
her bedside and were given the opportunity to say their 
goodbyes.  Autopsy was offered and declined.  

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  She went into a rapid 
ventricular rate with new onset atrial fibrillation with 
hypotension, requiring initiation of amiodarone IV for control.  
She converted to sinus rhythm. Given her goals of care, 
amiodarone was discontinued and her telemetry was discontinued 
for her comfort.  

# Leg Wound: The patient's leg wound was superficial and treated 
by wound care.
.  
# Goals of Care:  After a discussion with the family, the 
patient was made DNR/DNI, no ICU transfer, no pressors, no 
invasive procedures, all confirmed with family on numerous 
occasions.
