Brief Hospital Course:
Presented same day surgery and was taken to the operating room 
for aortic valve replacement.  She tolerated the procedure well 
please see operative report for further details.  Post 
operatively she was taken to the intensive care unit for 
management on neosynephrine.  That evening she was weaned from 
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without 
complications.  She was weaned off neosynephrine and had burst 
of atrial fibrillation treated with IV Lopressor converted back 
to SR.  She later required neosynephrine off and on for blood 
pressure support which by afternoon of post operative day one 
she was able to be fully weaned off.  She was started on 
betablockers and diuretics.  Later that evening she remained 
clinically stable and was transitioned to the floor. Chest tubes 
and epicardial wires were removed per protocol.  On post 
operative day two she had brief burst of atrial fibrillation 
treated with betablockers and converted to sinus rhythm, 
additional treated with blood transfusion for post operative 
anemia.  She continued to progress and worked with physical 
therapy on strength and mobility.  She remained in sinus rhythm 
until early morning of post operative day four lasting less than 
1 minute and betablockers were adjusted with no further 
episodes.  She was ready for discharge home with services on 
post operative five.
