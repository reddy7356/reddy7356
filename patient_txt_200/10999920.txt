Brief Hospital Course:
# Legal: ___
# Medical: The patient presented with several horizontal 
scratches on her L forearm, which were noted to be warm, 
erythematous, and with mild serous discharge.  She was started 
on Bactrim DS BID, which she refused.  Her wound improved.

# Psychiatric: The patient was started on suboxone 8mg SL daily 
for heroin withdrawal, and after three days this was tapered to 
4mg SL daily, and then again to 2mg SL daily for three days.  
Her prescribed dose of wellbutrin (which she had not been 
taking) was initially held while she was inpatient, as her 
reported formulation was different than the hospital pharmacy 
formulation.  However, at her request, this was restarted as SR 
at 150mg daily.  She was also treated with seroquel 300mg QHS, 
gabapentin 300mg QID, and klonopin 1mg BID.

The patient was initially vague about the reasons for her SIB, 
suggesting that it was done instrumentally for inpatient 
admission.  She later said that she cut herself to relieve 
overwhelming emotions.  She did not report improved mood during 
her hospital stay, and was very focused on continuing her stay 
until she felt she was ready to go.  When a future discharge 
date was suggested to her, she said "What if I'm not ready then? 
 What if I become suicidal?" One emotive outburst occurred over 
the weekend; patient however was consolable and no further 
episodes transpired.

On day of discharge: patient reported better mood, denied any SI 
or impulse toward SIB. Affect was brighter. Patient was in 
agreement to leave and felt ready for discharge. She was able to 
contract for safety, and displayed future goal orientation. 
Boyfriend of ___ years arrived to the unit at time of patient's 
discharge.
