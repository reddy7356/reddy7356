History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ M with history of coronary artery disease 
s/p CABG in 1990s (4V: RIMA to LAD, LIMA to diagonal, SVG to OM, 
SVG to PDA), CVA x2 since ___, on coumadin for strokes, also 
history of IDDM and Renal Cell Carcinoma s/p unilateral 
nephrectomy in ___ (unknown baseline Cr) who initially 
presented to ___ with abdominal pain found to have 
gangrenous cholecystitis s/p lap cholecystectomy and developed 
acute myocardial infarction postop now transferred to our CCU 
for futher management.
 
Patient initially presented to ___ with 24 hours of 
colicky abdominal pain, RUQ in nature also with associated 
nausea and vomiting without diarrhea, hematemesis, GIB, chest 
pain or dyspnea. CT abdomen performed which showed gallbladder 
distension, wall thickening and pericholecystic stranding 
consistent with cholecystitis. Labs notable for a lactate of 
2.8, K of 5.0, Cr 2.3, T.bili or 0.8, normal ALT/AST/ALP, WBC of 
22.4 with 75% PMNs and 16% bands. He was admitted to ___ 
where he was treated with IV ABx and taken to the OR. In the OR 
a Lap Chole was performed with drainage for gangrenous 
cholecystitis with diffuse oozing from the liver bed requiring 4 
units FFP to reverse coumadin therapeutic INR. He received 1 
unit pRBCs post-op for 500cc of blood loss. He was kept 
overnight in the ICU and was stable overnight. Post-op troponin 
was 0.07 considered likely demand ischemia from sepsis and known 
coronary artery disease. Around 5am of ___ patient 
developed acute dyspnea without chest pain and desaturated to 
high ___. Troponin checked during that time was 21 which 
uptrended to 31.4 the morning of transfer on the ___. Unclear 
if patient received a Plavix load but home medications document 
he is on 75mg daily, he received a full dose aspirin but did not 
receive aspirin or plavix this morning because patient unable to 
swallow. He denied any chest pain during this troponin rise and 
there were no events on telemetry. Morning of transfer the 
patient was found to be in new acute renal failure to Cr of 3.0 
along with the Troponin of 31. He was deemed not a 
catheterization candidate given single kidney and acute renal 
failure to Cr of 3.0. Additionally, patient found to have 
pneumonia, CHF exacerbation and repeat TTE showed LVEF of 35% 
with apical akinesis and diffuse hypokinesis. He was unable to 
tolerate PO intake so received 5mg IV metoprolol and PR aspirin. 
Also maintained on Heparin drip (started on ___ for NSTEMI 
currently therapeutic PTT at Heparin 950units/hr. Patient has 
been hemodynamically stable while on stress dosed steroids 
(hydrocortisone 50mg IV BID) as pt takes fludrocortisone on 
chronic basis.

mid to distal inferior/infero-apical akinesis. Portions of the 
basal to mid septum are near akinetic. No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal 
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated 
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly

Brief Hospital Course:
___ M with history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, 
coronary artery disease s/p CABG, admitted to ___ initially 
with cholecystitis s/p cholecystectomy who developed acute MI 
and respiratory distress from CHF exacerbation, transferred to 
___ for further management without percutaneous coronary 
intervention due to tenuous renal status.
   
# NSTEMI: Patient presented with troponinemia in the postop 
setting (s/p cholecystectomy), likely demand ischemia. EKG 
without significant ST or other worrisome changes. He did not 
have chest pain and remained hemodynamically stable. However, he 
has poor functional status at baseline, with multiple 
comorbidities as well as CKD, and thus risks of intervention 
would seem to outweigh benefits. A TTE showed severely decreased 
left ventricular ejection fraction (25%), with global LV 
hypokinesis and regional mid to distal inferior/infero-apical 
akinesis. He was initially managed with heparin drip, and was 
later transitioned to ASA 81 / Plavix 75mg / Coumadin 3mg / 
Metoprolol 25mg TID / Atorvastatin 80mg. At the time of 
discharge, he remained asymptomatic. Would consider restarting 
ACE-I given SCHF and CAD for afterload reduction as outpatient. 
  
# CHF exacerbation: Chronic systolic CHF with LVEF of 25%. 
Patient does not use O2 at home, however presented with a new 
oxygen requirement. Pt with pleural effusion and congestion 
consistent with acute exacerbation of systolic CHF, ejection 
fraction 25%. He did not have cough or sputum production to 
suggest pneumonia. A TTE showed severely decreased left 
ventricular ejection fraction (25%), with global LV hypokinesis 
and regional mid to distal inferior/infero-apical akinesis. He 
was treated with lasix for diuresis, and was started on 
metoprolol as well as nitroprusside. ACE-I was held given his 
___ (see below). At the time of discharge, he maintained high 
oxygen saturation without supplemental O2. 
 
#AOCKD: Unknown baseline Cr but patient with history of CKD, s/p 
nephrectomy as pt with h/o RCC s/p nephrectomy and with Cr 
ranging from 2.2 to 2.6 at OSH. Patient with sepsis 
(cholecystitis source) and thus hypovolemia/prerenal azotemia 
likely cause of ___. This was worsened with diuresis for his 
sCHF. ACE-I was held during this admission, and his renal 
function improved with discontinuation of diuresis. At the time 
of discharge his Cr was 2.1 and thought to be back to baseline.
 
# Cholecystitis: s/p Lap Chole with 3 drains placed (and d/c'd) 
for continued oozing and gangrenous cholecystitis. Bile cx from 
OSH grew Klebsiella, sensitive to levofloxacin. He was treated 
with levofloxacin and flagyl from ___ to ___, and was 
transitioned to ciprofloxacin alone. On day of discharge day 8 
out of 14 day course of Ciprofloxacin. On discharge remains with 
slight leukocytosis of 13.4 however afebrile wihtout evidence of 
active infection.  
   
# Delirium: A&Ox2 on admission with unknown baseline after 
suffering two CVAs in past. ___ have vascular dementia with 
acute delirium postoperatively. No neuro deficits on exam. Urine 
on admission cloudy, and with leukocytosis. He was treated with 
antibiotics for his klebsiella intra-abdominal infection, and 
his leukocytosis and his mental status improved. 
  
# CAD: s/p CABG in 1990s, without chest pain during admission. 
His troponin was high on admission, likely due to demand 
ischemia and AOCKD. He was treated with ASA, statin, plavix, and 
beta blocker.
    
# Hypertension: he was continued on his home metoprolol. His 
fludrocortisone (for orthostatic hypotension) was initially held 
and resumed prior to discharge. 
 
# Hyperlipidemia: continued atorvastatin 80mg.
  
# Diabetes: Chronic Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, Type 
II, in good contgrol with HgA1C was 6.6 on admission. Treated 
with ISS while hospitalized.
   
Transitional Issues:
- Restart ACE-I given LVEF of 25%
- Patient has history of hemorrhagic stroke and is on plavix and 
warfarin so cautious with additional 
antiplatelets/anticoagulation
- Return to coumadin 5mg as outpatient when cipro course 
completed
- Monitor improvement in fever curve and leukocytosis as an 
outpatient with completion of Cipro course

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because after having your 
gallbladder taken out you were having a heart attack as well as 
a heart failure (decreased pumping function) exacerbation with 
shortness of breath and respiratory failure. At the same time 
your kidney funciton was poor likely in the setting of low 
perfusion or blood flow to the kidneys. 

Because your preexisting conditions and your acute kidney 
failure, we decided that the risk outweighed the benefit of 
percutaneous coronary intervention and decided to manage your 
heart attack with medications. 

You also developed an infection at the site of where your 
gallbladder was removed. Because of this you are on antibiotics 
and will continue them for a total of 14 days.   

Because of your heart failure it is important that you weigh 
yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 
lbs in two days.
 
Followup Instructions:
