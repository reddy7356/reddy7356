IMAGING
==============

EXAMINATION:  CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.
 
INDICATION:  ___ man with incidental left upper lobe 
subsegmental
pulmonary embolism on CTA neck
 
TECHNIQUE:  Axial multidetector CT images were obtained through 
the thorax
after the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast.
Reformatted coronal, sagittal, thin slice axial images, and 
oblique maximal
intensity projection images were submitted to PACS and reviewed.
 
DOSE:  Total DLP (Body) = 327 mGy-cm.
 
COMPARISON:  CTA neck ___.
 
FINDINGS: 
 
CTA:  There are segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli 
involving right
upper, right lower, left upper, and left lower lobe.  The right 
and left main
pulmonary arteries are dilated measuring 25 and 28 mm 
respectively.  There is
no intraventricular septal flattening.  There is mild left 
atrial enlargement.
The thoracic aorta is normal in caliber without aneurysmal 
dilation.
 
CHEST:  There is no axillary, supraclavicular, or mediastinal 
lymphadenopathy.
The thyroid is normal.  Heart size is enlarged.  There is no 
pericardial
effusion.  Coronary artery calcifications are moderate.
 
Airway is are patent to the segmental level bilaterally with 
bronchial wall
thickening at the lung bases likely reflective of chronic 
inflammation.  There
is no focal lung consolidation.  There is no evidence of 
pulmonary infarction.
Scattered calcified granulomas are present.  There is bibasilar 
atelectasis.
 
The thoracic esophagus is unremarkable.  Views of the upper 
abdomen are
normal.  Superficial soft tissues are notable for bilateral 
gynecomastia.
 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Mild compression of T3 and T7 are unchanged 
from ___.  Compression deformity of T5 has minimally increased from 
___.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Pulmonary emboli involving the segmental and subsegmental 
right and left
upper and lower lobe pulmonary arteries.  No evidence of 
pulmonary infarction.
No evidence of acute right heart strain.
2. Lower lobe bronchial wall thickening, likely related to 
chronic
inflammation.
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ intensivist (MD) with hx of htn, recent C2 fracture with 
planned operative repair ___ presenting with incidental, 
asymptomatic PE discovered on CT head/neck for C2 fracture.
 
# Multiple pulmonary emboli: The patient recently underwent CTA 
neck as part of operative workup, and a subsegmental PE was 
noted in LUL as an incidental finding. Patient subsequently had 
CTA to further characterize PE, which revealed multiple 
segmental and subsegmental PEs. Patient does note he has been 
spending more time in bed in setting of C2 fracture. Denies any 
fevers, chills, night sweats or weight loss. Up to date on 
colonoscopy ___ years ago. No lower extremity swelling noted on 
exam. Patient denied chest pain or shortness of breath. No 
respiratory distress on exam. Patient was started on 
weight-based lovenox. He was stable and asymptomatic on 
discharge. Neurosurgeon notified by email regarding initiation 
of anticoagulation and need for perioperative anticoagulation 
planning.

# Hypertension: stable, continued on amlodipine and lisinopril.

# C2 fracture: C2 fracture 9 weeks prior to admission for which 
he is in SOMI brace with plan for operative repair on ___ 
with Dr. ___.  Patient was given tylenol for pain and 
continued use of SOMI brace. 

# Depression: continued sertraline  
# Glaucoma: continued dorzolamide  
# Insomnia: continued Ativan 2 mg QHS  (transitional issue to 
d/c given fall)

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
======================
- Lovenox ___ SC daily- duration 3 months given first DVT, can 
discuss other anticoagulation options with patient
- Further work up for PE and presumed DVT, patient with no lower 
extremity edema so lower extremity ultrasound was deferred
- Up to date cancer screening 
- Consider discontinuation of lorazepam QHS given increased risk 
of fall and delirium
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
