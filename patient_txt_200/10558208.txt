History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a lovely ___ woman who recently noted a 
right inguinal
mass.  She was seen by her primary care physician and this mass 
was biopsied.  This revealed poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma.  Immunohistochemical staining revealed the tumor 
to be CK7 positive, CK20, CDX2, mammaglobin and GCDFP negative.

gynecologic malignancy.  ___ went on to have an MR of the 
abdomen and pelvis.  This revealed a 3.4 cm abnormal node in the 
right inguinal region, multiple uterine fibroids, a left 
inguinal enlarged lymph node measuring 1.6 cm and a Gartner's 
duct cyst and an indeterminant enhancing 1.1 cm lesion at the 
junction of segments VI to VII of the liver, possibly 
representing an
atypical fibrosed hemangioma.  A CT scan of the chest was 
performed, which revealed a 2.3 cm spiculated right breast 
lesion either primary malignancy versus post-treatment change, a 
heterogeneous 17 mm right thyroid nodule, a right lobe 
ground-glass opacity consistent with chronic aspiration. She 
underwent hysteroscopy, D&C on ___ which showed serous 
endometrial cancer. She presents at this time for surgical 
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, Ms. ___ was admitted to the gynecology oncology 
service after undergoing total robotic hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingo-oophorectomy, bilateral pelvic and right para-aortic 
lymph node dissection, right inguinal lymph node excision, and 
cystoscopy for cytoreduction of stage IVB endometrial cancer. 
Please see the operative report for full details.  

Her immediate post-operative course was complicated by apnea, 
which required stat re-intubation in the OR. She was ultimately 
extubated without complication in the post-anesthesia care unit. 
Post-operatively, her pain was controlled with IV morphine, 
toradol, and tylenol. On post-operative day 1, her urine output 
was adequate so her foley was removed and she voided 
spontaneously. Her diet was advanced without difficulty and she 
was transitioned to PO percocet, ibuprofen, and ativan. She was 
restarted on her home medications for hypertension and 
depression.

By post-operative day 2, she was tolerating a regular diet, 
voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was 
controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home 
in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled.
