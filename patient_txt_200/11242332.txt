Spine MRI
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings indicative of epidural phlegmon with epidural 
abscess posterior
to the thecal sac from L2-3 to L4-5 level, predominantly at L2-3 
and L3-4
levels with small epidural abscesses. There is compression of 
the thecal sacby the enhancing epidural tissue ___ the epidural 
abscess.
2. Left paraspinal soft tissue enhancement involving the erector 
spinae
muscle at L3 level, predominantly with small fluid collections 
indicative of small intramuscular abscesses.
3. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes ___ the cervical, thoracic, 
and lumbar
region without high-grade spinal stenosis.
5. No evidence of cord compression.
6. The findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at the time 
of
interpretation of this study on ___ at 4 p.m.
. 
___ TTE
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall 
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic 
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image 
quality. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot 
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. There is mild pulmonary artery 
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild mitral regurgitation 
with normal valve morphology. Normal biventricular cavity sizes 
with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D 
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.  
.
___ TEE:
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen ___ the body of 
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right 
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection 
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral 
valve. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. No 
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no 
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation with normal 
valve morphology. No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.

cultures
         positive for Staphylococcus aureus and ___ species. 

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during 
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are 
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four 
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may 
be
         warranted.  Rifampin should not be used alone for 
therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo woman with a history of TKR/THR, admitted with bacteremia, 
encephalopathy, new LBBB (transient, now recurrent), and 
epidural abscess.  She was persistently febrile.  Also with 
diffuse rash, which does not appear consistent with drug rash, 
but more with heat dermatitis.
.
# MSSA Bacteremia: The source of her bacteremia was likely her 
epidual abscess.  She had no risk factors for the abscess.  No 
recent admissions, no recent instrumentations, no recent 
illnesses. Ms. ___ was at risk for endocarditis. She had a new 
LBBB on EKG from ___. A transthoracic echocardiogram was 
done and was negative for endocarditis, however it was poor 
image quality.  We had a transesophageal echo done and it was 
negative for vegitations or abscess.  She had positive blood 
cultures with MSSA on ___ and brushings from surgery on 
___ that were MSSA as well.  She was started on vancomycin 
due to a penicillin allergy.  She was admitted to the MICU for 
desensitization of nafcillin, which went without complication.   
Her fever curve decreased and she became afebrile.  Her cultures 
were perisistently negative after starting with the cultures 
from ___. She was discharged on an ___ week antibiotic course. 
 
.  
# Laminectomy/lumbar abscess: She had surgery ___ and ___ 
surgery a bilateral L2 laminotomy, L3, L4 Laminectomy, bilateral 
L5 Laminotomy were performed with removal of the epidural 
abscess, debridement, and biopsies of the deep muscle and deep 
bone.  Her pain was controlled with dilaudid and it was 
transitioned to oxycodone PO, and she did well postprocedurally. 
 Her neurologic exam remained stable without deficit.    
.  
# Delirium: Post procedurally she was transferred to the SICU, 
and she was delirious.  It was likely a combination of her 
narcotics and concomitant treatment with benzodiazepines ___ the 
setting of bacteremia. Her IV pain medication was transitioned 
to PO and her benzodiazepines were stopped.  As her infection 
improved and her pain was controlled with PO medications and the 
benzos cleared her mental status became much improved.  At the 
time of discharge she was back to her baseline.
.
# LBBB/VTach: She has had intermittent LBBB and a run of 17 
beats of VTACH. She had negative TTE and TEE with normal LV 
function, she was ruled out for MI at OSH.  No complaints of 
chest pain. Repeat 12 lead showed resolution of LBBB. EP 
evaluated strips, and thought it to be NSVT, with nothing to do. 
No need for follow-up.
.
# Hyponatremia: She became hyponatremic to 130.  Her thiazide 
was held, and as her pain was controlled her sodium improved. 
.  
# Glucose intolerance: Likely ___ the setting of bacteremia and 
stress reaction vs. chronic glucose intolerance. Her HgbA1c was 
5.9%.
.
# Anemia: hct decreased since surgery to 27.  Baseline on this 
admission was 34. It improved after surgery. 
.  
# HTN: She was kept on Metoprolol and her thiazide was 
discontinued because of the hyponatremia.  
.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___, it was a pleasure taking part ___ your care. You were 
admitted to ___ because of confusion, fevers, and intense back
