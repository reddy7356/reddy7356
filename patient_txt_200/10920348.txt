CXR
1. Large left base opacity concerning for 
consolidation/pneumonia. Recommend 
followup to resolution. Small left pleural effusion and 
atelectasis not 
excluded. Otherwise, evaluation of the lungs is suboptimal due 
to patient's 
respiratory motion and patient's chin overlying the left lung 
apex. 
2. Persistent severe thoracic scoliosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo woman with cerebral palsy admitted with 
fevers and found to have a LLL PNA, sepsis, respiratory acidosis 
and pancytopenia. The patient was DNR/DNI and the family felt 
strongly about this. They did agree to a central line for fluid 
resuscitation and antibiotics as well as pressors. She was 
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics (flagyl, vanc, cefepime, 
levo) and received norepi and dopamine. She was supported on 
bipap. Her respiratory acidosis worsened. There was also 
suspicion for possible hematolic malignancy given the number of 
atypical cells on her differential. An additional family meeting 
was held and given her rapid decline combined with the knowledge 
that she had lived so much longer than any of her family had 
hoped for, the family elected to focus on her comfort. Pressors 
were discontinued as well as bipap. She passed within several 
hours of withdrawing this support and was comfortable for the 
time she had remaining, and was surrounded by family. Given her 
rapid decline and the question of an underlying malignancy, the 
family elected to have an autopsy. The father was contacted and 
interviewed. He was deemed to be not competent to consent due to 
dementia. The siblings with the exception of some siblings (out 
of a total of 11) who were out of contact with the family all 
requested autopsy.
