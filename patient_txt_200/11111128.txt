History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ old man with a history of depression, one
prior generalized seizure and hypertension who presents with an
episode of altered mental status.

Patient reports that he awoke around 7 AM this morning feeling
well.  He had breakfast and was getting ready for work.  He went
upstairs to his room in order to take a shower but never got 
into
the shower.  His father came into the bathroom after some period
of time and found his son sitting on the floor, with his back to
him.  The patient was rocking back and forth and seemed confused
about why he was on the floor.  He was able to respond to his
name and turned around but did not know why he was not in the
shower.  There is no obvious signs of trauma such as tongue 
bite,
urinary incontinence or head laceration.

His parents took him to ___ where he had basic lab work
including a leukocytosis to 12, lactate of 1.5, normal
chemistries and negative serum tox screen.  He did have a
temperature to 100.9.  He remained confused for approximately 1
hour after arrival to the emergency department.  His parents now
feel that he is about "90 percent of normal."  

Further history reveals that patient has had at least 2 other
discrete episodes of confusion in the past week that his parents
have noticed, including one episode where the patient went
upstairs for unclear reasons and looked confused and annoyed. 
The parents cannot recall the other episode.  His mom also
describes episodes of fatigue and nodding off frequently, which
is unusual for him.

He has had a cough and runny nose recently but denies any fever
or chills.  He has not had any headache, neck pain or neck
stiffness. 

Of note, he did have a C5-6 operation at ___ on ___ ___nd shoulder pain.  He was discharged from the hospital on
___ without complication.  He did not require ___ or OT.

He has a long-standing history of depression and anxiety which 
is
treated with ketamine infusion, last 2 weeks ago.  He also uses
intranasal ketamine about ___ times per week.  Additionally, he
is intermittently using buprenorphine for pain and depression. 

With regard to his prior seizure, this was a presumed 
generalized
seizure in ___ of this past year.  He was evaluated by Dr.
___ in the epilepsy clinic.  Per her records, patient
went to watch television and then about ___ minutes later had
an event that he does not recall.  He woke up to EMS in his room
and feeling confused.  He reported sore muscles and tongue
laceration but no incontinence.  Etiology of the presumed 
seizure
was thought secondary to sleep deprivation as well as use of IV
ketamine infusion in the preceding few days.  He underwent
high-resolution MRI of the brain which did not show any evidence
of mesial temporal sclerosis.  He did not have an EEG.  He was
not started on medication.  He has not had any further events
since that time.

In the setting of these frequent episodes of confusion at home 
in
the past week, in discussion with neurology at ___, the
decision was made to transfer patient for continuous EEG
monitoring to evaluate for complex partial seizures.

Risk factors:
Normal birth and development. 
No febrile seizures. 
No head injury.

in the setting of dehydration and not eating.  He reports that 
he
has not eaten all day while being in the emergency room.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted because your father found you confused on the 
bathroom floor. It was unclear what this event was, but you were 
taken to ___ where you stayed confused for about an hour. 
You have also had several episodes of confusion of unclear 
etiology. We are suspicious that these were seizures, but we are 
unsure of the cause. We are suspicious of ketamine and how it 
may build up in your system leading to seizures after your 
infusions, but it is unclear at this time. Given your history of 
a likely seizure in ___ and these episodes of confusion, we 
have started you on a new medication called DEPAKOTE ER. Please 
take 1500mg every night. It also has a mood stabilizing effect, 
so we are hopeful that it will help your depression as well.

While you were here, your EEG did not show any seizures. You 
also had an LP done, which showed elevated protein of unclear 
etiology. You had an MRI of your brain afterwards, which did not 
show any abnormalities. You will follow up in outpatient 
epilepsy clinic.

Please do not drive for the next 6 months per MA state law. 
Please do not swim or take a bath unsupervised. Do not climb on 
high objects without supervision as you may be at risk for 
falling.

It was a pleasure taking care of you, and we wish you the best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Team
