•Ulcers in the incisura of the stomach, antrum and pylorus
•Nodule in the fundus
•Ulcers in the gastroesophageal junction (biopsy)
•Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

___ Biopsies:
1. Gastroesophageal junction:
- Severely active esophagitis with focal ulceration and 
fibrinopurulent
exudate.
- Special study results for fungi and HSV will be reported in a 
revised
report.
- Cardiac-type mucosa with chronic inflammation; no intestinal
metaplasia seen.

2. Antrum:
Antral mucosa with focal foveolar zone hyperplasia; no 
significant
inflammation identified. See note.
Note:  The findings are non-specific, but may be seen with 
adjacent
ulceration. Correlation with endoscopic findings is recommended.

 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/history of achalasia s/p ___ myotomy/fundoplication 
presents with abdominal pain and vomiting found to have multiple 
gastric ulcers.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:  
 
# Gastric ulcers:  
Patient's epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting, and imaging 
findings of antral thickening were consistent w/gastritis vs. 
peptic ulcer disease. There was no evidence of acute GI 
bleeding. An EGD was done that showed erythema, congestion, and 
ulceration in the antrum (biopsied), ulcers in the incisura of 
the stomach, antrum and pylorus, nodule in the fundus, and 
ulcers in the gastroesophageal junction (biopsied). She was 
treated with 40mg omeprazole BID, sucralfate 1gm QID, standing 
calcium carbonate, and maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine with 
great improvement in abdominal pain. She was tolerating a 
regular diet when discharged. H. pylori serology was obtained 
and pending at time of discharge. She was afebrile and 
hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization.
   
CHRONIC ISSUES: 
 
# Asthma: Patient reported not being consistent with taking 
Flovent though had not had any recent asthma attacks. Denied 
wheezing or shortness of breath. However, there was wheezing on 
auscultation throughout her stay. She did not need further 
treatment for her asthma during this hospitalization. She was 
discharged on Flovent 2 puffs BID, pt advised to adhere to this 
regimen daily, as well as Albuterol inhaler PRN. Can optimize 
asthma treatment as outpatient. 
 
# Vitamin D deficiency: Patient had not been taking Vitamin D. 
Vitamin D level came back low at 14. Consider repletion as 
outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:  
- f/u H. pylori serology to determine whether triple-therapy 
indicated -> returned negative
- f/u stomach biopsies
- Will need to stay on omeprazole 40mg BID, sucralfate 1gm QID, 
and calcium carbonate PRN for 8 weeks
- Will need repeat EGD in 8 weeks to assess for healing, and 
consider EUS at that time as well to further evaluate submucosal 
nodule in the fundus
- With regards to asthma, was discharged on Flovent 2 puffs BID, 
pt advised to adhere to this regimen daily, as well as Albuterol 
inhaler PRN. Can optimize asthma treatment as outpatient. 
- Vitamin D level low at 14, recommend repletion as outpatient
- Avoid all NSAIDS.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___. As you know, 
you were admitted for abdominal pain and vomiting. You had an 
endoscopy which showed many ulcers in your stomach that caused 
your pain and vomiting. You were treated with high-dose acid 
blocking medicines, sucralfate, and tums with significant 
improvement in your abdominal pain. You were considered safe for 
discharge as you were tolerating a regular diet without issue. 

It is very important to stay on these medications for the next 8 
weeks to allow the ulcers in your stomach to heal. Please 
follow-up with your PCP as scheduled below. You will need a 
repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks to ensure healing of the ulcers. We 
also checked for the presence of H. pylori, a bacteria that can 
cause stomach ulcers. The results of this test are still pending 
and will be communicated to your PCP. 

In the meantime, it is extremely important to avoid all NSAIDS 
(ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve, etc.), as use of these 
medications can worsen ulcer disease.

As for your asthma, we noticed some mild wheezing while you were 
in the hospital. It is important to take Flovent as prescribed 
on a daily basis regardless of how your breathing feels. You 
will be going home with an albuterol inhaler that you can use 
for shortness of breath and wheezing as needed.

We wish you the best of luck!

LABS: see below

.

EKG: NONE

.

CXR: 
FINDINGS: No previous images. The heart is normal in size and 
lungs are 
clear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion. 

.

CT SCAN NECK (WET READ):
1. No neck mass, fluid collection, or lymphadenopathy seen. 
2. Moderately distended fluid-filled proximal esophagus warrants 
further 
evaluation with an esophagram. 
3. Moderate maxillary and ethmoid sinus disease. 
4. 5-mm right thyroid nodule. 

.

BLOOD/URINE CULTURE: NGTD 
.

OTHER DIAGNOSTICS:
PROCEDURES

Last Colonoscopy  ___
 Diminuitve nodules bx removed at 30 and 20cms.
PATH: hyperplastic

___ EGD

Mucosal inflammation noted in the antrum with streaky erythema. 
Biopsy obtained, results pending. 
Esophageal biopsies obtained from the mid-proximal portion of 
the esophagus. Some white plaques seen in esophagus which I 
believe is residual cetacaine

.
1. RANDOM GASTRIC ANTRUM BIOPSY:
Antral mucosa with mild chronic gastritis and increased 
eosinophils.
Giemsa stain is negative for increased mast cells and highlights 
the
eosinophils.
Multiple levels examined.
Immunohistochemical stain for H. pylori is NEGATIVE (appropriate
control slides reviewed).
.
2. ESOPHAGUS BIOPSY:
Squamous esophageal mucosa, negative for diagnostic abnormality.
PAS stain is negative for yeast.

IMAGING
Barium swallow: ___ 
The swallowing mechanism appears normal. No esophageal mass, 
ulcer, or constricting or obstructing lesion is demonstrated. 
There was some degree of stasis of barium in the esophagus with 
the patient upright. The barium refluxed from the mid and lower 
esophagus toward the upper esophagus at this time. This resolved 
spontaneously over approximately 1 minute. Some tertiary 
contractions are noted in the distal half of the esophagus. No 
hiatus hernia or gastroesophageal reflux was demonstrated. 
Barium was observed to flow freely into the stomach and from the 
stomach into the duodenum and proximal small bowel. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Mild transient stasis and tertiary contractions in the 
esophagus. This may signify dysfunctional motility. 
2. Otherwise, negative examination. Specifically no mass, ulcer, 
or evidence of obstruction. 
.
___ ___ s/p polypectomy with path demonstrating benign polyps 
per patient. 

.
EGD (___):
There was spasm at the LES making it difficult to pass the scope 
into the stomach. The esophagus appeared mildly tortuous without 
dilation. There were multiple tertiary contractions. (biopsy, 
biopsy)
Erythema, friability and ulceration in the antrum compatible 
with erosive gastritis (biopsy)
Erythema and friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with 
mild duodenitis (biopsy)
Nodule in the fundus (biopsy, endoclip)
Polyp in the fundus (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient is a delightful ___ year old female with a history of 
asthma who presents with a ___ year history of dysphagia more 
recently with odynophagia and weight loss. 
.
Dysphagia, Odynophagia and Weight loss: Likely due to a motility 
disorder, such as achalasia.  A upper endoscopy was performed 
which showed a spasm in esophagus suspicious for achalasia.  It 
also showed a nodule in the fundus suspicious for leiomyoma, 
this was biopsied.  It showed posibble eosinophilic 
esophagitis/gastritis and biopsies were taken to look for this.  
These biopsies should be followed up.  Also, she may require 
therapy if they show eosinophilic infiltrates.  Given the 
gastritis, her omeprazole dose was increased to 40 mg twice 
daily.  Serologies were sent for Chagas disease and were pending 
at the time of discharge.  These will also need to be 
followed-up.  We were unable to complete the motility work-up as 
an inpatient as these studies are not done for inpatients.  The 
patient was tolerating fluids and mechanical soft diet at the 
time of discharge.  Her labs were notably not consistent with 
dehydration indicating that she is able to maintain hydration as 
an outpatient.  Also, a CT neck was performed given her 
complaint of a neck mass and this was notable only for 
dilitation of the esophagus but negative for any neck masses or 
lymphadenopathy.  
Of note, the neck CT also showed a small thyroid nodule.  
Further work-up deferred to outpatient.
. 
Asthma: She was continued on her flovent.  
.
Low grade temp on admission and coughing:  She remained afebrile 
during her time in the hospital.  A CXR was performed and was 
negative.  Blood and urine cultures were NGTD at the time of 
discharge.  Suspect cough more likely to be due to her asthma.  
.
FOLLOW-UP/PENDING TESTS:
- esophageal and gastric biopsies
- final read of neck CT scan
- further work-up of thyroid nodule as indicated.
