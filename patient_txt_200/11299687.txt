Discharge LAbs: 

Pertinent Studies:
CT Abd/Pelvis ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Small retroperitoneal hematoma with hemorrhage extending into 
a right inguinal hernia sac and alongside the right spermatic 
cord.
2. Small hiatal hernia.
3. Calcifications within the pancreas, likely sequela of chronic 
pancreatitis.

Echo ___:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free 
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, 
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular size and global systolic 
function. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the basal inferior wall has normal function on the current 
study. 

L Heart Cath: 
Report pending, please see finalized report when available
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ hx of CAD s/p CABG in ___ transferred from OSH for chest 
pain and shortness of breath. 

Active Issues:
#Chest pain: Negative trops but found to have V5-V6 depression 
on subsequent EKG, concerning for new ischemia. He was diuresed 
given his shortness of breath with improvement and taken to cath 
lab where angiogram showed occluded SVG to OM, appearing chronic 
in nature. Medically optimized and continued on nitro gtt post 
procedure for blood pressure control as symptoms had resolved 
prior to cath. Echo showed Normal biventricular size and global 
systolic function. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.

#Hematoma: Patient complained of groin pain at cath site, though 
no tenderness to palpation or signs of hematoma. He was found to 
have a small RP hematoma which was not significant in size and 
therefore was managed expectantly. 

Chronic Issues:
# CAD. s/p 3V CABG in ___. LIMA graft to the LAD and vein 
grafts to a circumflex marginal and the distal right coronary 
artery. Continued on ASA, metoprolol, and  Atorvastatin.  

# CKD. Patient's Cr 1.4 appears to be baseline. Cr 1.3 in ___ 
and per PCP note, recent admission to ___ Cr was 1.4  

# HTN: continued amlodipine at home dose 2.5 BID

# DM type II: continued on home lantus 40mg QHS, held 70/30 
whiel inpatient and given ISS with adequate control of blood 
glucose.  

# HLD: Atorvasatin as above was continued. 

# Esosinophillia. Patient has had chronic esosinophilla. Given 
country of origin, sent Strongyloides IgG, pending at time of 
discharge.  

# ___ disease: continued on home dose Carbidopa-Levodopa. 
 

Transitional Issues
#Consider transitioning to metoprolol succinate as an 
outpatient, and uptitration as needed. Could consider carvedilol 
for better HTN and rate control
#Imdur uptitrated to assist with angina, cont as needed as an 
outpatient
___ not used given hx of hyperkalemia

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted for chest pain in the presence of complex 
coronary disease.  You had changes in your EKG which was 
concerning for new blockage and were taken for a cardiac 
catherization.  You were found to have a chronically occluded 
vessel from your previous coronary bypass surgery.  An echo was 
ordered, but was not obtained to monitor your heart function and 
should be ordered by your primary cardiologist if desired.  You 
were having groin pain which kept you in the hospital for one 
additional night and was controlled.

We have increased your dose of imdur. You should continue your 
remaining medications.

Please follow up with your PCP/cardiologist next week. Please 
call your PCP on the next business day to make an appointment.  
He is aware of your hospitalization.

Please be well.

Your ___ Team
