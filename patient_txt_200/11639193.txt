URINE CULTURE (Final ___: 
      YEAST.    10,000-100,000 ORGANISMS/ML..

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly 
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis 
(LVEF = 20%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated 
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal 
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular 
pressure/volume overload. A bioprosthetic aortic valve 
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well 
seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. 
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve 
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well 
seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. 
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid 
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic 
dysfunction. Dilated right ventricle with moderate global 
systolic dysfunction and pressure/volume overload. 
Well-functioning aortic and mitral bioprostheses. Moderate to 
severe functional tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary 
hypertension.  

CXR:
FINDINGS:  Persistent cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary 
vascular
congestion and interstitial edema.  Small bilateral pleural 
effusions are
present, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMHx CHF (EF 35%), A Fib on warfarin, s/p AVR and MVR 
for rheumatic heart disease and recent admission for CHF 
exacerbation, pneumonia, and Afib with RVR s/p pacemaker 
placement who presents s/p fall with minimally displaced 
fractures of the right superior and inferior pubic rami.

#Status-Post Fall: Appears to have been somewhat orthostatic 
causing her to fall. Plan per ortho is conservative management 
with Rehab. Exam and ECG non-concerning at this time. Patient 
initially received pain control with tylenol, tramadol and 
oxycodone.  However, her BP dropped as low as 70/40 on ___ and 
narcotics were discontinued. She received tylenol and a 
lidocaine patch for pain thereafter. Physical therapy evaluated 
and worked with the patient.

#Hypotension: BP dropped as low as 70/40 on ___. Unclear 
etiology, although differential included blood loss (which is 
unlikely given stable Hct), infection (which is unlikely given 
infectious studies negative to date), narcotic related, 
ACS-related (which is unlikely given no changes on EKG), 
systolic dysfunction, intravascular volume depletion, or 
autonomic dysfunction. She received gentle IV fluid hydration. 
She was encouraged to eat and drink. Her metoprolol, 
spironolactone, and torsemide were held given hypotension. SBP 
came up to ___ outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ was 
contacted and recommended changing metoprolol succinate to 
metoprolol tartrate at a lower dose (25 mg PO BID) given 
hypotension and the fact that she is now paced as well as 
changing spironolactone to 12.5 mg every other day.  Her 
metoprolol was restarted in the tartrate form at 25 mg PO BID on 
___.  Her torsemide 10 mg PO daily was restarted on ___. 
Spironolactone was restarted at 12.5 mg PO every other day on 
___.  At___ cardiology was consulted and recommended an ECHO 
and BNP. BNP was elevated at >22,000 and ECHO showed LVEF of 20% 
with RV dilation and pressure/volume overload (therefore LVEF 
may be inaccurate given volume overload and possible bowing of 
RV into LV which would falsely lower LVEF measurement).  Her 
torsemide was continued for diuresis. Her BP was stable at >100 
for more than 24 hrs in the day prior to discharge.

#Systolic CHF with EF ___: Patient had crackles and 
peripheral edema on exam, likely mildly volume overloaded. Her 
outpatient cardiologist Dr. ___ was contacted regarding what 
medications patient should be on; Dr. ___ 
changing metoprolol to tartrate form and decreasing dose to 25 
BID, decreasing spironolactone dose to 12.5 QOD and consider 
increasing torsemide dose to 10 mg alternating with 20 mg if 
patient is significantly volume overloaded. In setting of low BP 
(70/40) on ___, her metoprolol, torsemide and spironolactone 
were held. Her metoprolol was restarted on ___ in the tartrate 
form at a dose of 25 BID. At___ cardiology was consulted and 
recommended an ECHO and BNP. BNP was elevated at >22,000 and 
ECHO showed LVEF of 20% with RV dilation and pressure/volume 
overload (therefore LVEF may be inaccurate given volume overload 
and possible bowing of RV into LV which would falsely lower LVEF 
measurement).  Torsemide 10 mg PO daily was restarted on ___. 
Her spironolactone was restarted at 12.5 mg every other day on 
___. Patient was not on an ACE-inhibitor (perhaps related to 
elevated Cr).An ACE-inhibitor was not started during this 
hospitalization.  The initiation of an ACE-inhibitor was 
discussed with Dr. ___ recommended holding off on 
starting an ACE-i given patient's hypotension. The initiation of 
an ACE-i should be discussed with patient as an outpatient.

#A Fib on Warfarin: Patient's INR was supratherapuetic at 5.0 on 
___. Warfarin was held and INR was allowed to drift down.  
Metoprolol was held due to hypotension but was restarted in the 
tartrate form at 25 BID on ___. Digoxin level was high at 1.3 
on ___ (per recent discharge summary, goal level is 0.5-0.8), 
discussed with Dr. ___ recommended decreasing dose to 
0.0625 mg QOD (does not reach steady state for ___ days so 
digoxin level will need to be checked the week after discharge). 
Dr. ___ put in patient's pacemaker was contacted regarding 
pacemaker rate of 90 bpm and he advised that he will not change 
the pacemaker rate during this hospitalization. She will require 
close follow-up with cardiology Dr. ___ 
electrophysiologist Dr. ___ Dr. ___ pacemaker 
interrogation and lowering of the pacemaker rate.

#Constipation: Patient was continued on senna and colace with 
polyethylene glycol as needed.

#Diabetes: Patient's glipizide was held and she was placed on a 
gentle humalog sliding scale while in ___ and ___'s ranged 
from 100s-200s.  She will be restarted on glipizide upon 
discharge.

#Emphysema: Patient received albuterol and ipratropium nebs and 
was continued on home inhalers.

#Gout: Patient's allopurinol was held initially but restarted 
prior to discharge.

OP REPORT - DEBRIDEMENT OF RIGHT HALLUX ___
PRE-OP DX: RIGHT HALLUX INFECTION
POST-OP DX: GOUT
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  After informed consent was
obtained, the patient and the debridement site were correctly
identified and marked.  Preoperative protocols were then
completed, and under mild sedation the patient was brought to
the operating room, where she remained on her hospital bed,
in the supine position.  After the right hallux was marked
and identified again, it was prepped in a sterile fashion.
Again, no tourniquet was used.  No antibiotics were given by
Anesthesia due to her previous course of antibiotics which
was given on the floor.  At this time, the right lower
extremity was scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual
sterile fashion and a total of 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine were
injected into the right hallux.

At this time, a linear incision was made on the dorsal aspect
of the right hallux and this was carried down to the
subcuticular layer.  The extensor hallucis longus was then
identified and retracted laterally, and the incision was
carried down to the level of the bone.  It was noted that
once this incision was made a copious amount of gouty tophi
was present.  These gouty tophi were collected and sent away
for microbiology.  A rongeur was then used on the proximal
phalanx and a bone sample was collected on the rongeur.  This
bone was sent for pathology and microbiology.  A Freer
elevator was used to remove gouty tophi that were located
through the IPJ of the right hallux.

At this time, a copious amount of irrigation was used to wash
out the IPJ of the right hallux, and after adequate washout,
___ nylon was used to realign the skin and close the
incision.  It is of note that there was no excessive bleeding
from this incision.  Adaptic was then placed over the intact
sutures.  We applied 4 x 4's and a Kerlix lastly and an Ace
bandage was wrapped around that.  The distal circulation was
then evaluated and seemed to be adequate to all remaining
digits.  The patient was then transported to the
postanesthesia care unit with vital signs stable and vascular
status intact to the right foot.  The patient tolerated the
procedure and anesthesia well, with no apparent
complications.  All sponge, needle, and instrument counts
were reported to be correct.  Estimated blood loss was
minimal.  Bone and gouty samples were sent to Pathology and
Microbiology.  It should be noted that Dr. ___ was present
and scrubbed for the entire procedure.

Imaging:
___ Imaging FOOT AP,LAT & OBL RIGHT  
IMPRESSION:   
1.  Cortical destruction in the proximal phalanx of the great 
toe consistent with osteomyelitis.  A small step off along the 
distal surface of the proximal phalanx may just be cortical 
irregularity, although a small fracture cannot be excluded. 
2.  Cortical loss in the distal phalanx of the great toe, also 
consistent with osteomyelitis. 
3.  No evidence of subcutaneous gas. 
.
___ Imaging CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEM  
FINDINGS:  The right PICC line extends to the lower portion of 
the SVC, just above the cavoatrial junction.  Evidence of 
previous valve replacements with intact midline sternal wires.  
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with some prominence of 
ill-defined interstitial markings.  Some of this could reflect 
elevated pulmonary venous pressure, though in the presence of 
hyperexpansion, this also can be a manifestation of chronic 
pulmonary disease.

was unclear whether this was due to an infection that was 
getting worse on intravenous antibiotics at home or another 
process such as gout. ___ were seen by the podiatry and 
infectious disease team here. ___ were continued on intravenous 
Vancomycin. However, the bone and fluid from your toe joint 
looked more like gout than infection. ___ will stay on 
antibiotics until we are sure that no bacteria are growing in 
the fluid we sampled (this will likely take a few days)

Changes have been made to your medication regimen.
CHANGE warfarin (aka coumadin) 1mg daily to 2mg daily

___ will take 1 vial (500mg) of an antibiotic called vancomycin 
daily until we determine that ___ do not have an infection. Dr. 
___ will be able to tell ___ the results of your culture at

Dear Ms. ___,

It has been a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. You 
were admitted for shortness of breath, found to be due to a 
heart failure exacerbation. This may have been caused by too 
much salt in your diet or not taking the correct dose of your 
diuretic. You were treated with diuretics to a dry weight of 50 
kilograms. You were also treated for a urinary tract infection. 
You should continue to take your medications as prescribed and 
adhere to the low salt diet. You should follow up with your 
cardiologist as below.

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F with atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, CHF with LVEF of 
35%, and COPD on 1 L who presents with a 2 week history of 
increasing shortness of breath and a 6 pound weight gain 
admitted with an acute CHF exacerbation, AFib with RVR, and 
hypotension.

# Acute decompensated heart failure: Systolic. LVEF in ___ 
___ 25% down from prior readings of 35%. Unclear precipitant. 
Troponins negative. Patient also with progressive dyspnea on 
exertion, orthopnea, and weight gain (up to 140 lb from 133 lb 
dry weight.).  Pt. was aggressively diuresed with furosemide 
drip and her symptoms and weight improved.  It was felt that her 
tachycardia due to afib with RVR was likely contributing to her 
symptoms.  She was rate controlled with beta blockade and 
eventually AV nodal ablation and pacemaker placement (see 
below).  She was discharged on metoprolol, torsemide, 
spironolactone, and digoxin.

# Hypotension: Likely due to AFib with RVR and severe volume 
overload compromising cardiac output. Improved with diuresis.

# ___: Cr 1.8 elevated on admission from baseline of 1.4, likely 
due to CHF exacerbation. After diuresis her creatinine varied 
between 1.5 and 1.7.  

# Atrial fibrillation: Afib with RVR felt to be contributing to 
above heart failure.  Rate control was initially attempted with 
metoprolol, but as this was insufficient, she underwent AV nodal 
ablation and pacemaker placement without complications. Pt. was 
placed on warfarin for anticoagulation.

# Pneumonia: Pt. treated for presumed pneumonia with cefepime. 
Sputum culture with GNR's, GPR's, yeast, and Aspergillus. Pt. 
with mild leukocytosis and cough, but no fevers. She completed a 
5 day course of antibiotics.

# Type II diabetes: Pt. was placed on humalog insulin sliding 
scale.  Her home glipizide was held.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued home statin.

# COPD: Continued home regimen.

# Gout: Continued allopurinol with renal dosing.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- further optimization of medical management of CHF including 
addition of ACEi
- pacer interrogation with Dr. ___ in one week post-discharge 
(scheduled)

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REHAB:
- draw INR biweekly with goal ___, adjust warfarin dose as 
needed
- draw daily chem 7 to monitor potassium and electrolytes while 
on torsemide and spironolactone, replete as needed
- draw weekly digoxin level with goal 0.5-0.8, adjust dose as 
needed
- 4L O2 via nasal cannula
- daily weights
- call MD if weight increase by more than 3 pounds or if pt. has 
increasing shortness of breath or increase oxygen requirement 
- ___ per routine
- consider restarting glipizide on discharge from rehab

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted to ___ due to increased shortness of breath. 
We felt this was due to heart failure with fluid overload.  You 
were given diuretic to remove fluids. Your heart rate was also 
fast and in an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation.  You 
underwent a procedure to stop this rhythm and had a pacemaker 
placed.  You did well and your symptoms improved. You will need 
to have continue to take your medications and make sure your 
weight stays stable. If you start having increaasing shortness 
of breath or your weight increases by more than 3 lbs, please 
contact your doctor.

It was a pleasure taking care of you. We wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

Your cardiology team at ___
