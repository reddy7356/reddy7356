History of Present Illness:
HPI:

This is a ___ year old right handed woman with a history of

consolidated (150mg BID->300mg QHS) and lamictal restarted. This
morning she awoke as usual and said she had increased 
"agitation"
over impending weather. She denies true unsteadiness, says she
felt the "ground was about to open up underneath her".  When
asked what she means she says, "well, you know, with terroism 
and
the tornado". She walked to the store to get some food for the
storm and says that while crossing the street she caught her 
foot
on the wheel of her grocery cart and fell down on her knees. She
was assisted up by passersby and was taken to the ED by a police
officer. At ___ she was reportedly unsteady with a wide based
gate and demonstrated "expressive and receptive aphasia". She 
was
also tremulus and had dysmetria on finger to nose. ___
records state that she woke up with the symptoms so felt that
though she likely have a stroke, she was outside of the window 
so
sent to ___ for neuro eval and MRI.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,
numbness, parasthesiae.

MR brain and MRA head & neck ___:

MR BRAIN:  There is no abnormally slow focus of diffusion to 
suggest 
infarction.  Ventricles and sulci are enlarged, reflecting 
parenchymal volume 
loss.  Note is made of multifocal bilateral white matter 
cerebral T2-weighted 
and FLAIR hyperintensities, indicative of chronic microvascular 
disease.  
There is no intracranial hemorrhage.  Primary intracranial flow 
voids are 
normal. 
  
MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE BRAIN:  Primary intracranial arterial 
structures show 
appropriate flow-related signal hyperintensity.  There are no 
luminal caliber 
irregularities to suggest thrombolic filling defect, aneurysm or 
dissection.  
Anatomy is conventional in orientation. 
  
MR ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK:  Note that non-contrast 
time-of-flight imaging was 
performed, due to the patient's inability to receive contrast.  
Technique is 
limited at the origins of the common carotid and vertebral 
arteries 
bilaterally, and thus those segments are not well evaluated.  
However, luminal 
caliber of the distal common carotid arteries, vertebral 
arteries and internal 
carotid arteries are normal bilaterally, with no evidence of 
pseudoaneurysm, 
dissection or thromboembolic filling defect.  There is no 
hemodynamically 
significant stenosis. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  No abnormally slow focus of diffusion to suggest infarction 
and no 
intracranial hemorrhage. 
2.  Normal evaluation of the arterial vasculature of the head 
and neck. 

___ Renal u/s:
FINDINGS: 
  
Small bilateral highly echogenic renal cortices are seen.  The 
right kidney 
measures 9 cm in craniocaudal dimension and the left kidney 
measures 9.4 cm in 
craniocaudal dimension.  Minimal renal pelviectasis is noted 
bilaterally, 
slightly more prominent on the left. However, there is no 
significant 
underlying obstructive uropathy. Note of two small left sided 
anechoic renal 
cysts are noted. 
  
Well-distended urinary bladder is noted without significant wall 
thickening, 
internal debris or obvious mass.  Ureteral jets are noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Small echogenic kidneys consistent with diffuse renal 
parenchymal disease. 
No evidence of significant obstructive uropathy. 
2.  Two small left simple renal cysts. 
3.  Normal urinary bladder. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old right-handed woman with a history of 
bipolar disorder with multiple recent hospitalizations (last 
discharged on ___, DM and HTN who is presenting as a transfer 
from ___ with unsteady gait, fall and a question of aphasia. 
The time of onset and description of symptoms is difficult to 
ascertain given that pt is a poor historian and there were no 
family or witnesses. On speaking to her it appears that she 
recalls what appears to have been a mechanical fall where her 
foot got caught in the wheels of a shopping cart but before this 
never noticed any unsteady gait or difficulty understanding or 
producing language. On her initial exam she was noted to be 
diffusely tremulous, have poor attention, a postural tremor and 
unsteadiness. She does say odd/eccentric things and needs 
frequent refocusing but there is no language disorder. She was 
also in acute on chronic renal failure. 
On re-exam on ___, pt has clear signs of mild parkinsonism 
(cogwheeling, en bloc turning, retropulsion); however, her gait 
is mostly stable, and per ___, she will be able to return home 
with home or outpt ___. Overall, her presentation is most 
consistent with effects of psychiatric polypharmacy. 
During this admission, pt was maintained on her previous 
medications. Her presentation was discussed with both her 
prescribing psychiatrist, Dr. ___ her psychiatric 
therapist, Dr. ___. It was agreed to leave her psychiatric 
medications unchanged until outpatient follow up. 
The acute-on-chronic renal failure (with an initial Cr of 2.3) 
was worked up with an unrevealing urinalysis & sediment, 
negative eosinophils, negative post-void bladder scan, and a 
renal ultrasound, which showed small echogenic kidneys 
consistent with medical renal disease but no obstructive 
uropathy. Cr improved to 1.8 on day 2 after IV fluids, and 
remained at this level on day 3 of the hospitalization. This may 
be pt's new baseline. 
Pt was found to have a urinary tract infection, and was treated 
with a 5-day course of ciprofloxacin, of which she received 2 
days in house. 
As pt was unsure whether her home medications were arranged 
correctly in her pillbox at home, she was given individual doses 
of all her medications in 2 separate bags for the evening of 
discharge and the next morning. Pt will call her ___ to come the 
day after discharge to organize her pillbox.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted after a fall. This was likely a mechanical 
fall, where your foot got caught in the wheels of a shopping 
cart. However, on physical exam we discovered that you were a 
little bit unsteady on your feet. We obtained an MRI of your 
brain, and there was nothing of concern on that. Specifically, 
you did not have a stroke. 
Your unsteadiness is likely secondary to your psychiatric 
medications. This may improve as you get used to the new doses 
of the medications. However, you should also discuss this issue 
with your psychiatrist, to see if some of your medications can 
be changed.
Incidentally, we discovered that you have a urinary tract 
infection. Please finish the antibiotic course that you started 
in the hospital: we will give you three more days of 
ciprofloxacin tablets.

Please follow up with your primary care physician and your 
psychiatrists.
 
Followup Instructions:
