History of Present Illness:
Very nice ___ year old gentleman who with past medical history of 
COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and s/p AAA/EVAR in ___. He 
was noted to have asymptomatic PVCs in the pattern of bigeminy 
by EKG at the time of visit to PCP ___ ___. An echocardiogram 
was performed and demonstrated interval development of mild 
systolic dysfunction with LVEF 45%. A nuclear stress imaging 
showed moderate to large areas of ischemia in the LAD and RCA 
territory.
He underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed 
multivessel disease and he was referred for surgical 
revascularization. He states that he is sometimes fatigued and 
short of breath with exertion but has been attributing this to 
old age and COPD.  He denies chest pain, recent fevers/chills, 
nausea/vomiting and
lower extremity edema. 

CT surg recommended surgery to reduce the pts risk of future MI 
and/or death.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Catheterization: Date: ___    Place: ___ 

Coronary Circulation:
The coronary circulation is right dominant. There was signifcant
2 vessel coronary artery disease (LAD and RCA)
Left Main: angiography showed minor luminal irregularities
LAD: multiple discrete lesions, this is an excellent target for
bypass. 
Ostial LAD: There was a discrete 80% stenosis
Proximal LAD: there was a discrete 90% stenosis
Circumflex: angiography showed mild atherosclerosis
RCA: the vessel was very large sized (dominant). Angiography
showed multiple discrete lesions. This is an excellent target 
for
bypass
Proximal RCA: there was a tubular 100% stenosis
Distal RCA: there was a tubular 70% stenosis
Right PDA: this is an excellent target for bypass
___ posterolateral segment: the vessel was large sized. There 
was
a tubular 100% stenosis in the proximal third of the vessel
segment. This is an excellent target for bypass.

Cardiac Echocardiogram:

Carotid Ultrasound:

Pulmonary Function: 

Nuclear Stress: ___
Abnormal nuclear perfusion images.

There is a large in size, moderate to severe, partially
reversible perfusion defect affecting basal inferior, mid
inferior, and apical inferior segment corresponding to
___ ischemia in the RCA distribution.

There is a moderate in size, moderate in severity, partially
reversible perfusion defect affecting apical anterior, and 
apical
segments corresponding to ___ ischemia in the distal 
LAD
distribution.

Mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with regional
wall motion abnormalities as detailed above, LVEF 42%.

There are no prior images available for direct comparison.
.
L-mibi ___:
There is a large in size, moderate to severe, partially
reversible perfusion defect affecting basal inferior, medial
inferior, and apical inferior segment corresponding to
___ ischemia in the RCA distribution. There is a
moderate in size, moderate in severity, partially reversible
perfusion defect affecting apical anterior, and apical segments
corresponding to ___ ischemia in the distal LAD
distribution.

Mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with regional
wall motion abnormalities as detailed above, LVEF 42%.

Intraoperative TEE: POST-OP STATE: The TEE was performed at 
13:00:00. Sinus rhythm.
Support: Vasopressor(s): none.
Left Ventricle: Systolic function is improved. Improved regional 
function in anterior and inferior
territories Global ejection fraction is normal.
Right Ventricle: No change in systolic function.
Aorta: Intact. No dissection.
Aortic Valve: No change in aortic valve morphology from 
preoperative state. No change in aortic
regurgitation.
Mitral Valve: No change in mitral valve morphology from 
preoperative state. No change in valvular
regurgitation from preoperative state.
Pericardium: No effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted as a same day admission, was taken to the 
operating room on ___ and underwent Coronary artery bypass 
graft x4, total arterial revascularization,  skeletonized left 
internal mammary artery sequential grafting to diagonal and left 
anterior descending arteries, left radial artery graft with a 
segment of left internal mammary artery extension, sequential 
grafting to posterior left ventricular branch and posterior 
descending arteries. Please see operative note for full details. 
Pt tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the ___ 
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. 
  
Pt was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact, and 
was extubated on POD 1. Pt was weaned from vasopressor support. 
Nitroglycerine was transitioned to Isordil for radial artery 
graft patency. Beta blocker was initiated and pt was diuresed 
toward his preoperative weight. Pt remained hemodynamically 
stable and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery. He had a brief episode of atrial fibrillation which 
converted with Lopressor. No anticoagulation was required. 
Lopressor was increased for ectopy and heart rate control. Pt 
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance 
with their strength and mobility. He was kept additional days 
for more aggressive diuresis with ambulatory O2 sats in the 80's 
(history of COPD, as well). Home inhalers were restarted. 

Discharge was initially held due to volume overload though 
patient was minimally symptomatic. He was discharged on POD6, 
well below his preop weight. Pt was ambulating freely without 
symptoms. His O2Sats continued to dip mid-high 80's at 
discharge. Pt remained asymptomatic while walking. A room air 
ABG was done showing pH 7.44, paO2 62, pCO249 , all wounds were 
healing, and pain was controlled with Tylenol. Pt was discharged 
home w/services in good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
