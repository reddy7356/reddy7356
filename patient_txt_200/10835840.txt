headache, N/V, diarrhea, abd pain otherwise.

She reportedly has history of iodine ?contrast allergy in past.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
-She began having unprovoked episodes of falling ___. She
underwent further workup by ___ Neurology in ___ with 
MRI/MRA,
EEG, and cardiac workup. On ___ she presented with
lightheadedness and underwent NCHCT that was significant for 
left
parieto-occipital brain lesion, edema and midline shift. She

CTA CHEST

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic abnormality. 
2. Re-demonstration of 9.0 cm right upper lobe mass with 
invasion of the chest 
wall destruction of the right second and third ribs similar to 
prior. 

CT head

  
1. Status post left parietal craniotomy and resection with 
interval 
development of encephalomalacia in the resection cavity.  
Evaluation for 
recurrence in this region is limited on the current modality and 
better 
assessed with contrast enhanced MRI. 
2. Subtle hyperdensity in the left frontal lobe, likely 
corresponding with the 
known metastatic lesion seen on prior MRI from ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ was initially admitted with chest pain; a CTA chest 
showed no PE, but demonstrated right rib infiltration from her 
CA. Her EKG and troponin were likewise not suggestive of 
ischemia. Her pain was very pleuritic, and localized over the 
rib lesions -- therefore, this was most consistent with cancer 
pain. Her symptoms were also dramatically improved after having 
a large bowel movement. Her pain was well controlled with her 
home dose of oxycodone. She received a single dose of radiation 
for her brain metastases while she was an inpatient, and was

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with history of drop attacks, presents with

 Left parieto-occipital brain lesion with MLS and a large right 
apical lung mass. 

 
#Left parieto-occipital brain lesion  
Patient was admitted to ___ from Emergency Room for further 
management. She was started on keppra, dexamethasone. She went 
to the OR on ___ for L craniotomy for tumor resection, which 
was uncomplicated; please see full operative note in OMR for 
further detail. Her neurological exam improved postoperatively, 
and remained stable while in the ___. She was transferred to

hospitalized and was deemed stable for discharge home with 
outpatient follow up. She will follow up in office and brain 
tumor conference for further oncologic follow up. She will 
remain on Keppra and Dexamethasone until follow up. 

Neuro-oncology and radiation oncology were consulted for

therapy and occupational therapy and was cleared for discharge 
home. Case management was able to facilitate visiting nurses for 
home care and social work helped to set up medical 
transportation for patient's follow up appointments. 

#Agitation

than secondary neoplasia. Thoracic surgery was consulted and 
recommended no intervention as long as tissue would be obtained 
from the brain mass.
