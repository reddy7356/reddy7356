Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH of severe basilar artery stenosis, depression (w/

vasovagal syncope who p/w syncopal event during ___ thought to be 
___ recurrent vasovagal syncope, also found to have ___ 
which improved with treatment, whose hospital course was c/b 
intermittent sundowning

Investigations/Interventions:
#Syncope: 
As per son, patient has history of several vasovagal syncopal 
events, some even c/b sinus pauses. Since event prior to 
hospitalization occurred while stooling, thought to be 
recurrence of vasovagal syncope. EKG with anterior qwaves, but 
troponins ruled out acute event. No significant arryhtmias on 
telemetry. Given repeated syncopal events ___ presumed vagal 
tone, atenolol was discontinued. CT head and neck did not show 
e/o acute stroke or complication of syncope.  Pt was given 
gentle IVF as well. 

#UTI: 
Pt found to have uncomplicated UTI, and culture remained pending 
on discharge. Leukocytosis resolved with treatment. Pt 
transitioned from ceftriaxone to Bactrim with plan for ___. Would repeat UA at rehab to ensure that 
infection has cleared s/p treatment

___: 
Pt presented with Cr of 1.2 that decreased to 0.7 w/ IV fluids. 
Most likely prerenal ___ which may have predisposed patient to 
syncope during presumed vasovagal attack.

#HTN: 
As above, atenolol was discontinued. SBP following 
discontinuation were 110-180, with highest pressures in morning. 
Accordingly, would recommend that amlodipine be given at night 
before bed so that it is most active during morning when she 
experience's high BP.

#Hyperactive delirium
#Dementia
#Depression (w/ psychotic features)
Patient was noted to sundown consistent with her recent history 
and was maintained on nighttime olanzapine to good effect

#Low back Pain/Sprain: 
___ fall in the shower weeks ago. Given lack of bony injury and 
fact that weeks have passed from prior event discontinued 
oxycodone dosing.

Transitional Issues:
1. 3 day course of Bactrim from ___. Would repeat UA at 
rehab to ensure that infection has cleared s/p treatment
2. Would reassess BP at rehab s/p adjusting amlodipine to 
nighttime dosing
3. Pt requires significant rehab to restore her prior functional 
status according to our ___ assessment
4. Pt found to have isolated elevation in Alk Phos of unknown 
significance. Would recommend repeat in 1 week as outpatient to 
assess if continually elevated.
