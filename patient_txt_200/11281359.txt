Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old Female with Hypertension, asthma, h/o ulcerative 
colitis, transferred from ___ for ongoing 
management of IBD flare, and for consideration of initiation of 
anti-TNF therapy. Patient reportedly has a history of a cavitary 
lung lesion of unclear etiology, and would need clarification 
prior to initiation. Additionally, it is noted that patient has 
a history of a pancreatic cyst, which may need further 
evaluation ___ the future.  

# Ulcerative colitis flare:   She was admitted and made NPO, and 
started on IV hydrocortisone.  She had decreased bloody 
diarrhea.  Overall it appeared that her symptoms had improved 
with the local rectal steroid treatment.  She will be discharged 
on prednisone, to be tapered by Dr. ___.  Consideration was 
given to infliximab, but was not required ___ the inpatient 
setting.

# Nausea and vomiting, epigastric pain:  She also presented with 
nausea and vomiting as well as epigastric pain, which did not 
appear consistent with a UC flare.  She had an ultrasound and CT 
that showed gall stones, and her episodic pain appeared 
consistent with biliary colic.  Her LFTs and amylase and lipase 
were normal, although she does have a history of pancreatitis, 
attributed to mesalamine.  She was evaluated by surgery, who 
recommended outpatient elective cholecystecomy

# Right lung cavitary lesion:  She had a chest CT that confirmed 
the presence of a right upper lung lesion, and underwent 
bronchoscopy.  The results of this are still pending.  She will 
follow up with Dr. ___ on ___.

# Hypertension, benign.  She had intermittent hypertension, with 
relative bradycardia.  The atenolol was discontinued, and she 
was started on lisinopril 10 mg po daily.  

# Asthma chronic stable; stable without current flare.  She had 
no respiratory complaints.

# Anemia; with hx of iron deficiency.  Iron studies were 
consistent with iron deficiency, and she will be started on iron 
on discharge when she is tolerating POs.

# Anxiety and depression:  She has a difficult social situation, 
and appeared extremely anxious and intermittently tearful.  She 
was seen by social work, and will find a local therapist.  ___ 
addition, she did not opt for an SSRI due to her GI complaints, 
but this will need to be addressed as an outpatient.

# Pancreatic cyst:  She has a known pancreatic lesion, and will 
be seen as an outpatient by Dr. ___ prior to treatment with 
infliximab, if infliximab is planned.
