IMAGING/STUDIES
==============
___ CXR: No acute intrathoracic procese

___ Echo:
The left atrial volume index is normal. Left ventricular wall 
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no 
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is 
likely related to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation 
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild 
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Aortic valve sclerosis. Mild mitral regurgitation. 

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, aortic sclerosis is seen and may 
account for the systolic murmur. The other findings are similar. 


MICROBIOLOGY
============
___ Lyme test: negative
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ yo M w/ PMH of HTN, obesity s/p gastric 
bypass (___), gastritis, iron deficiency anemia, OSA, who 
presented from PCP with bradycardia, dizziness, heart murmur, 
and ___. The dizziness and ___ resolved with 2L IVF. He was 
monitored on telemetry. His bradycardia remained sinus, and 
increased appropriately with activity. An Echo showed mild 
aortic sclerosis, which can cause the heart murmur. He remained 
hemodynamically stable, and was discharged. 

#Bradycardia
#Systolic Heart murmur
Patient presented with bradycardia with HRs in ___. Heart 
rates respond appropriately with activity. Orthostatic vital 
signs were negative. EKG not concerning for any ischemia, shows 
sinus bradycardia. Troponin negative. Serum tox negative. Urine 
tox negative. TSH normal. BNP only mildly elevated at 372. 
Lithium not elevated. Echo showed aortic sclerosis, which could 
cause the murmur. Telemetry showed some PACs but otherwise sinus 
bradycardia. Lyme titer still pending at time of discharge, and 
came back negative. 

___
The patient's baseline Cr is 0.8. His Cr on presentation was 
2.2. He received 2L of IVF. Likely pre-renal in the setting of 
hypovolemia and Lisinopril use. FeNa of 0.9% suggesting 
pre-renal etiology. CK normal. ___ responded to 2L IVF. His 
lisinopril was held at discharge. Consider starting an alternate 
anti-hypertensive like amlodipine. 

# Dizziness
Likely secondary to hypovolemia as this resolved with IV fluids. 
Orthostatic vital signs were negative. 

#Muscle cramping
Patient reported several weeks of muscle cramping relieved by 
flexeril. Electrolytes within normal limits. Likely in setting 
of dehydration. CK normal. Resolved with IVF.

#Iron Deficiency Anemia
#S/p gastric bypass
#Anastomotic ulcer
Patient is s/p gastric bypass surgery in ___. He was found to 
be iron deficient in ___ and received IV iron infusions. EGD in 
___ showed large anastamotic ulcer, and patient was started on 
pantoprazole. After 4 weeks, a repeat EGD showed resolution of 
the ulcer, and he stopped taking pantoprazole. B12 check in 
___ was within normal limits. Corrected reticulocyte index is 
1.1, which suggest that the bone marrow is not responding 
appropriately to anemia. Folate and B12 are normal. Iron was 
normal at 91. Ferritin mildly low at 29. TIBC and Transferrin 
were normal.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Lisinopril held at discharge because of ___. Consider starting 
an alternate antihypertensive like amlodipine.

Dear Mr. ___,
You were hospitalized at ___. 

Why did you come to the hospital?

low, but they increased into the normal range when you walked 
around. 

What do you need to do?
=======================
- It is very important that you follow-up with your primary care 
doctor ___ information below).

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. ___,
You were admitted to the hospital after an laparoscopic 
converted to open sigmoid colectomy for surgical management of 
your sigmoid cancer. You have recovered from this procedure and 
you are now ready to return home. 
Please monitor your bowel function closely. You may or may not 
have had a bowel movement prior to discharge which is 
acceptable; however it is important that you have a bowel 
movement in the next ___ days. After anesthesia it is not 
uncommon for patients to have some decrease in bowel function 
but you should not have prolonged constipation. However, you may 
have loose stool and passing of small amounts of dark, old 
appearing blood. If you notice that you are passing bright red 
blood with bowel movements or having large amounts of loose 
stool without improvement please call the office or go to the 
emergency room. 
You have a long vertical surgical incision on your abdomen. It 
is important that you monitor these areas for signs and symptoms 
of infection including: increasing redness of the incision 
lines, white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, increased pain 
at the incision, increased warmth of the skin at the incision, 
or swelling of the area.
You may shower; pat the incisions dry with a towel, do not rub.  
If you have steri-strips (the small white strips), they will 
fall off over time, please do not remove them. Please do not 
take a bath or swim until cleared by the surgical team.
Pain is expected after surgery. This will gradually improve over 
the first week or so you are home.  You should continue to take 
2 Extra Strength Tylenol (___) for pain every 8 hours around 
the clock. Please do not take more than 3000mg of Tylenol in 24 
hours or any other medications that contain Tylenol such as cold 
medication. Do not drink alcohol while taking Tylenol.  You may 
also take Advil (Ibuprofen) 600mg every 8 hours for 7 days. 
Please take Advil with food. If these medications are not 
controlling your pain to a point where you can ambulate and 
perform minor tasks, you should take a dose of the narcotic pain 
medication Tramadol.  Please do not take sedating medications, 
drink alcohol, or drive while taking the narcotic pain 
medication.
You may feel weak or "washed out" for up to 6 weeks after 
surgery. Do not lift greater than a gallon of milk for 3 weeks. 
At your post op appointment, your surgical team will clear you 
for heavier exercise.  In the meantime, you may climb stairs, 
and go outside and walk.  Please avoid traveling long distances 
until you speak with your surgical team at your post-op visit.

You are being discharged home on Lovenox injections to prevent 
blood clots after surgery. You will take this medication for a 
total of 30 days (including doses in hospital), please finish 
the entire prescription. Please monitor for any signs of 
bleeding: fast heart rate, bloody bowel movements, abdominal 
pain, bruising, feeling faint or weak. If you have any of these 
symptoms please call our office or seek medical attention 
immediately. Please avoid any contact activity and take extra 
caution to avoid falling while taking Lovenox.  

Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care, we wish 
you all the best!
