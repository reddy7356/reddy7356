vertiginous sensation but no difficulty sleeping and no changes

there was gradual improvement in nausea/vomitting but since
headache persisted, he went to OSH this morning where he had the

fever, night sweats of weight loss.  He denies any visual
disturbance other than occ. vertiginous sensation.  Also, no
