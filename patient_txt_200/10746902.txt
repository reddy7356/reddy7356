IMAGING
=======
CR Chest ___
Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and 
alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was 
obtained from the 
patient.The patient was then brought to the angiography suite 
and placed prone 
on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per 
___ protocol.  
The left flank was prepped and draped in the usual sterile 
fashion. 
  
The left nephrostomy tube could not be flushed.  The catheter 
was cut.  A 
Glidewire could not be advanced through the proximal portion of 
the tube.  The 
back end of the Glidewire was then advanced successfully through 
the tube.  
The Glidewire was then removed and then readvanced with the soft 
portion 
first.  The Glidewire was advanced into the proximal ureter.  
The catheter was 
removed.  A new 8 ___ nephrostomy catheter was flushed and 
advanced with 
its plastic stiffener over the wire into appropriate position. 
The wire and 
stiffener were removed and the pigtail was formed. Contrast 
injection 
confirmed appropriate positioning. The final image was saved. 
The catheter was 
then flushed, stay sutures applied and the catheter was secured 
with a Stat 
Lock device and sterile dressings.  The catheter was attached to 
a bag for 
drainage. 
  
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no 
immediate 
post-procedure complications. 
  
FINDINGS: 
1. Existing left nephrostomy tube was clogged and could not be 
flushed.  The 
tube appeared to be in appropriate position on scout image. 
2. Successful exchange with a new ___ F nephrostomy tube. 

Percutaneous Nephrostomy tube replacement ___
PROCEDURE: 
1. Left diagnostic antegrade nephrostogram. 
2. Left 8 ___ nephrostomy exchange.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with complicated medical 
history, including metastatic uterine cancer s/p multiple cycles 
of chemotherapy, XRT, and brachytherapy then with right psoas 
muscle metastasis and one right external iliac node currently 
undergoing Proton therapy at ___, as well as left sided 
obstructive uropathy s/p PCN in ___ who presented to ___ with 
one day of no drainage from PCN as well as significant LLQ and 
left flank pain after routine exchange of bag and stat lock by 
___ one day prior to admission. 

# Percutaneous nephrostomy block. Patient seen by ___. Bedside 
flushes unsuccessful. Nephrostogram showed persistent blockage 
and PCN was then successfully exchanged. Patient had immediate 
relief of pain and did well for duration of stay. Initially with 
leukocytosis of 14.7, downtrended to 9.8 overnight. 

# Leukocytosis: Presenting with left flank pain and WBC 14.8 on 
admission.  Given concern for urosepsis, one dose of zosyn given 
at OSH. Afebrile. Pressures stable. WBC trending down to 9.7 
prior to discharge. No signs or symptoms of infection. 
Preliminary blood cultures with no growth; UA grossly 
contaminated in setting of vesicovaginal fistula. 

# Anemia. Ms. ___ has a significant history of anemia, 
thought likely second to marrow suppression from multiple 
radiation episodes and chemotherapy. Per patient she was last 
transfused 2 units pRBCs 2 weeks ago, prior to last proton 
therapy administration. Possibly a component of blood loss; Ms. 
___ relays a history of vaginal bleeding noticed at her cuff 
site. H/H today prior to admission 9.5/___.5 down from 11.___.7 
___. Hemodynamically stable. No signs of bleeding from PCN 
exchange. Basic hemolysis labs were obtained here as well as 
reticulocyte count and appeared normal: Haptoglobin 374, LDH 134 
Absolute reticulocyte count .03 corrected reticulocyte count 0.7 
reticulocyte index .5. 

# Hypertension: Blood pressure ranging from 123-164/60-87. Held 
home amlodipine 5 mg

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
==========================
# Pain: acetaminophen ___ mg. Continued gabapentin 300 mg, 
morphine SR (MS ___ 15 mg, and oxycodone 10 mg

tolterodine 1 mg BID while in-house and discharged on home 
vesicare 5 mg.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================

3 months to every 2 months
- Holding home amlodipine in setting of low pressures
- Patient with long history of anemia. Per patient, last 
received blood transfusion 2 weeks ago. Basic hemolysis labs 
were obtained here as well as reticulocyte count and appeared 
normal: Haptoglobin 374, LDH 134 Absolute reticulocyte count .03 
corrected reticulocyte count 0.7 reticulocyte index .5. Hb and 
Hct on discharge 9.7 and 29.5.
