IMAGING:
  
___  ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. Non-significant Q waves ___ leads II, III, and 
aVF with
T wave inversions. Consider inferior wall myocardial infarction. 
No previous
tracing available for comparison.
 
___ Cardiac Cath:
COMMENTS:     
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system 
revealed
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LMCA, 
LAD, and
LCx had no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. 
The RCA
initial angiography showed severe proximal and distal PDA and PL 
branch
spasm, but following intracoronary nitroglycerine 
administration, the
spasm resolved entirely and there was no angiographically 
apparent
coronary artery disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed boarderline low 
systolic
arterial blood pressure.
3. Successful hemostasis achieved with proglide device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:    
1. Acute inferior STEMI due to coronary spasm, likely related to 
cocaine
use.
2. Continue IV Nitroglycerine
3. Severe hypoxia likely due to aspiration.
4. Severe respiratory/metabolic acidosis.
5. Cooling protocol for cardiac arrest.
  
___ EEG:
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study due to
mild to moderate background slowing with brief bursts of 
frontally
predominant, generalized theta slowing suggestive of mild to 
moderate
encephalopathy but of non-specific etiology. These changes could 
be due to
therapeutic hypothermia, anesthetic medications, or hypoxic 
brain injury.
There are no epileptiform discharges, electrographic, or 
clinical seizures.
  
___ Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal ___ cavity size. The 
estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular 
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate 
global left ventricular hypokinesis with severe hypokinesis to 
akinesis of the inferior wall (LVEF = 35%). The estimated 
cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). No masses or 
thrombi are seen ___ the left ventricle. A VSD is not seen but 
cannot fully be excluded due to suboptimal views. Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild 
free wall hypokinesis of the mid to distal ventricle. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis with 
severe hypokinesis to akinesis of the inferior wall. Dilated 
right ventricle with mid to distal free wall hypokinesis. Mild 
mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary hypertension. 
 
___ CXR:
Severe multifocal pulmonary consolidation is accompanied by what 
looks like
moderately severe pulmonary edema ___ the right lung.  ___ the 
left lower lobe,
there is probably a component of volume loss, but overall the 
relative
contributions of lobar collapse, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage 
and pulmonary
edema are really difficult to distinguish.  It is useful to note 
that the
heart is not enlarged and the mediastinal veins are not 
engorged.  At least a
moderate left pleural effusion is presumed.
Tip of the endotracheal tube, no more than 13 mm from the carina 
should be
withdrawn to 2 cm to avoid unilateral intubation.  An upper 
elementary tube
passes into the stomach and out of view.  Transvenous right 
atrial and right
ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are ___ standard 
placements.  No
pneumothorax
  
___ RUQ US:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Coarse echogenic liver, findings suggestive of cirrhosis.  
No focal hepatic lesion.
2.  Patent portal venous system with normal directional flow.
3.  Diffuse gallbladder wall edema likely secondary to chronic 
liver disease. No gallstones.
4.  Splenomegaly; minimal perihepatic ascites.
  
___ CXR:
CONCLUSION:
1.  Tubes and lines are ___ adequate position.
2.  Bilateral heterogeneous ground-glass opacities have worsened 
since
previous exam.  The differential diagnosis would include 
pulmonary edema or
pulmonary hemorrhage.
  
___ CTA Chest:
CONCLUSION:
1.  No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome.
2.  Bilateral ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal 
thickening are mostly secondary to pulmonary edema, considering 
the rapid change over the last days ___ chest x-rays.  This has 
significantly improved since ___. Differential 
includes spontaneous pulmonary hemorrhage, noncardiac edema. 
3.  Left lower lobe consolidation is probably a mix of 
atelectasis and aspiration pneumonia. It has improved since 
___.
  
___  CXR:
Widespread infiltrative pulmonary abnormality which worsened 
dramatically ___
the right lung between ___ and ___, already severe 
but worsened
___ the left lung simultaneously, first improved on ___ 
and has now
worsened again.  However, ___ the interim, the patient has been 
extubated, so
much of the change is due to lower lung volumes.  There is 
probably a
combination of residual edema as well as aspiration pneumonia 
and adhesive
atelectasis ___ the left lower lobe.  Small left pleural effusion 
is larger. 
Right jugular line ends ___ the mid SVC.  Transvenous right 
atrial pacer and
right ventricular pacer defibrillator leads are ___ their 
expected places.  No
pneumothorax.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with a PMH of coronary vasospasm-induced cardiac arrest ___ 
___ s/p AICD, hepatitis C c/b cirrhosis, bipolar d/o, asthma, 
and COPD who presented to ___ s/p cardiac arrest ___ 
the field. Transferred to ___ for cath which showed RCA 
vasospasm and resulting inferior MI, subsequently cooled per 
post-arrest hypothermia protocol with no loss of neurological 
function.  Hospital course complicated by likely aspiration 
pneumonia requiring intubation and transfer from the CCU to the 
MICU for management of her ventilation.
 
Throughout her hospital stay, the patient displayed poor insight 
into the severity of her illness.  On hospital day 7, two days 
after extubation, the patient insisted on leaving the ICU 
against medical advice (AMA).  She was seen by psychiatry who 
deemed her competant to make her own medical decisions. She 
verbalized understanding of her medical conditions and the risks 
of the leaving the hospital prior to being deemed medically 
stable for discharge, which included worsening respiratory 
status, worsening infection, and even death.  She decided still 
to sign out AMA and left the hospital with limited prescriptions 
for her medications ___ order to get her through until her visit 
with her outpatient providers. 
 
ACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
 
# ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION: found on cath to have 
complete vasospasm of her RCA with resultant inferior MI, which 
was reversible with nitro.  ___ light of the positive cocaine ___ 
her tox screens, this is consistent with cocaine-induced 
coronary vasospasm.  She was transferred to the CCU initially on 
a nitro gtt, however she became hypotensive requiring 
vasopressors, so the nitro was then turned off.  Initially she 
continued to have intermittent ST elevations, which would 
subsequently self-resolve.  Echo showed severe hypo/akinesis ___ 
inferior wall and depressed EF of 35% as a result of the 
infarction.  She was restarted on metoprolol, aspirin 325, and 
imdur on discharge.  Would recommend consideration of a calcium 
channel blocker as an outpatient and avoidance of cocaine.  She 
also should likely have a repeat echo ___ 6 months to determine 
if there has been any recovery of systolic function.  She has a 
follow up appt with her cardiologist Dr. ___ on ___. 
  
# CARDIAC ARREST:  Patient experienced VFib arrest, resulting ___ 
___ successful AICD shocks ___ the field (per EP device 
interrogation), however last episode lasted 15 minutes and she 
was not able to be shocked out.  She was initially ___ to 
outside hospital.  She then was transferred to ___ for cardiac 
catheterization that showed RCA vasospasm, with Utox positive 
for cocaine (see above).  Intracoronary nitro was injected for 
vessel patency.  Following cath, the patient was transferred to 
the CCU.  The post-arrest care team was consulted, and she was 
subsequently cooled per post-arrest hypothermia protocol.  EEG 
did not show any seizure activity.  She was successfully 
rewarmed with no evidence of severe neurologic damage from her 
arrest.  She was not initiated on any further agents despite her 
refractory VT/VF, however may consider agents such as amiodarone 
as an outpatient.
  
# ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA, HYPOXIC/HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE: 
 The patient has a history of COPD due to longterm smoking. No 
PFTs on record. She reportedly aspirated a large volume of 
gastric/feculant material after her arrest. CT chest from OSH 
demonstrated dense consolidations, left much worse than right, 
highly suspect for aspiration. O2 saturations initially mid ___ 
on arrival, with poor lung compliance noted on ventilator.  She 
was transitioned to the ARDsnet protocol, resulting ___ better 
ventilation and oxygenation. She was started on vancomycin and 
zosyn on ___ for pneumonia for a planned 8 day course.  She was 
also placed on standing albuterol/ipra nebs.  Her respiratory 
status gradually improved allowing extubation on ___, however 
she was extremely agitated and unable to follow commands and 
subsequently aspirated again that evening, resulting ___ 
re-intubation.   She was again extubated on ___ and was able 
to gradually wean down on oxygen requirements.  She was to 
finish her 8 day course of vancomycin and zosyn on ___, 
however given her decision to leave AMA, she was given another 
1.5 day supply of augmentin for oral antibiotic coverage. 
  
#  AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR:  the patient was extremely difficult to 
sedate on the ventilator and would repeatedly pull at tubes and 
lines, requiring restraints and large doses of sedation 
including precedex, propofol, fentanyl, and midazolam.  Upon 
extubation, she was verbally abusive and difficult to control 
behaviorally.  She was started on standing doses of haldol with 
additional PRN haldol and lorazepam used for acute escalations 
___ behavior.  Security was called a few times to assist ___ 
physically restraining her, and on the day that she left AMA, 
she kicked one of the physicians.  Psychiatry was involved and 
did deem her mentally competant to make her own decisions, so 
she was allowed to leave AMA after verbalizing an understanding 
of all the risks.  She would obviously benefit from further 
psychiatric care and substance abuse counseling as an 
outpatient.
 
# ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE:  per report, had previously had 
low EF following her arrest ___ ___ but her systolic function 
returned to normal on subsequent echo.  Her EF was found to be 
35% after this event.  Infiltrates ___ lungs related primary to 
infection, however likely did have some component of cardiogenic 
pulmonary edema.  Had just initiated diuresis prior to her 
leaving AMA, so she was not discharged on a standing diuretic.  
This will likely need to be started and titrated as an 
outpatient.  She should also have a follow up echo ___ 6 months.

INACTIVE ISSUES BY PROBLEM:
 
# COPD:  Diagnosis unconfirmed by PFTs.  She was continued on 
standing ipratropium/albuterol nebs. 
  
# BIPOLAR DISORDER:  restarted home aripiprazole after 
extubation.  Should follow up with her outpatient psychiatrist
  
# RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME:  Pramipexole held on admission.  
  
# GERD:  Omeprazole continued for GI prophylaxis.  
   
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- STEMI:  should consider initiation of calcium channel blocker 
and re-echo ___ 6 months to determine if there is any recovery of 
systolic function.  Has appt with cardiologist Dr. ___ on 
___
- Cardiac arrest:  could consider amiodarone for recurrent VT/VF
- Pneumonia:  will complete treament on ___ with augmentin 
- CHF:  may need to start a diuretic as an outpatient, is 
currently not on any
- Substance abuse, mental illness:  Would benefit from further 
psychiatric care and addiction counseling as an outpatient
- EMERGENCY CONTACT: ___ ___
