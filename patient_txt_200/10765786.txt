HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  

Mr ___ is a ___ y/o M with PMH significant for CAD (s/p DES to
___ LAD in ___, HTN, HLD, who presents for chest pain. 

Of note, this is a patient of Dr ___. In ___ he suffered
an NSTEMI with angiography showing total occlusion of the
proximal LAD which was stented successfully with a 3.0 x 12 mm
Promus drug-eluting stent. Otherwise there was 50% disease in 
the
circumflex, ramus and less in the right coronary.
Echocardiography initially showed anteroapical akinesis with an
ejection fraction of 31%. A subsequent echocardiogram on
___ showed persistence of anteroseptal and lateral
hypokinesis and apical akinesis but with ejection fraction
increased to 55%. He has had occaisonal chest pain since this
time, and underwent cardiac cath in ___ which showed patent
stent and otherwise stable disease. 

Patient notes that for the last few months he has had occasional
on and off chest pain.  The pain is described as in his upper
chest especially on the left side.  It is a dull aching 
pressure.
It is not clearly induced by activity and does not clearly go
away with rest.  Episodes last for hours.  Is better over the
last 2 weeks, however and within last 24 hours it started he 
once
again and this time radiated into his back.  Given his ongoing
symptoms, he presented to the emergency room.  An EKG did not
reveal any evidence of acute ischemia.  Troponins x2 were
negative.  Patient was then discussed with the cardiology 
fellow,
and is ultimately admitted for stress test.

Exercise Stress Test
  
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with h/o CAD s/p MI and LAD 

stent in ___ was referred to the lab for evaluation of chest 
discomfort. He exercised for 10 minutes and 30 seconds on

protocol and stopped for fatigue. The peak estimated MET 
capacity is

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with PMHx of HTN, HLD, CAD w/ MI in ___ s/p 
DES to LAD and HCV s/p interferon over ___ years ago who 
presented to the ED for evaluation of dark black stool. 

# Duodenal ulcer: Admission was preceded by about 2 weeks of 
lightheadedness with associated SOB, one day of dark bloody 
stool, and one day of dizziness. He continued on asa and 
ticagrelor during this time. In the ED hgb was 7.2, stool guiac

Conclusions   
 The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate to severe 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near 
akinesis of the distal half of the septum and anterior walls,

(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and 
no aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with mild [1+] mitral 
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 
 IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
severe regional systolic dysfunction (apical aneurysm without 
thrombus) in a pattern most c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Mild

SEE DETAILS BELOW BY PROBLEM

# Inferolateral STEMI
Presented with sudden onset chest pain, dyspnea, diaphoresis, 
found to have troponin elevated (peak 9.8) and ST elevations on 
EKG in inferolateral leads, s/p cath found to have 100% stenosis 
of LAD s/p DES.  On Echo, found to have apical akinesis, and 
depressed EF 33%.  Treated medically with Ticagrelor 90mg BID, 
Atorvastatin 80mg, ASA 81mg.  Switched home metoprolol to 
carvedilol 3.125mg BID for added blood pressure control.  
Started lisinopril 10mg to decrease afterload/demand.  ___ 
consulted, recommend outpatient cardiology rehab

#Systolic HF, (EF 33%)
Ischemic cardiomyopathy with apical akinesis/aneurysm, appears 
euvolemic on exam, 
started on lisinopril, carvedilol 3.125mg BID.

#Apical akinesis/aneurysm
No clot seen on Echo; starting warfarin for prevention.  INR 
1.4, discharged on Lovenox bridge.

#Hypertension
Prior past medical history, previously on meds (possibly 
lisinopril)until without insurance, then on no meds for ___ 
years.  Well controlled during admission on Lisinopril 10mg and 
Carvedilol 3.125mg BID

# Hx Hep C: Per patient, treated on interferon with successful 
remission.  Patient with mild chronic abdominal discomfort on 
presentation.  HCV positive, which could be consistent with 
exposure and resolved infection.  Viral load pending at time of 
discharge

***TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:***
- Patient should continue ASA 81 mg daily and Ticagrelor 90 mg 
BID x 12 months minimum
- Patient was started on warfarin for 3 months for prevention on 
thromboembolism in the setting of apical akinesis
- Patient was discharged on ___ bridge (100 mg BID SC), 
which should be stopped when INR is therapeutic
- Monitor INR and adjust dose of warfarin as needed
- Patient should repeat TTE in 4 to 6 weeks
- Monitor blood pressure and adjust blood pressure medications 
as needed
- Patient has HCV antibodies, HCV viral load was pending on 
discharge; please follow up on this issue and consider further 
management as needed

NEW MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin 81 mg once daily
Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You came to the hospital because you experienced chest pain. You 
were found to have a heart attack.

What happened to you during your hospital stay?
- You underwent an urgent heart catheterization and were found 
to have a complete blockage in one of the heart vessels.
- A stent was placed in the obstructed vessel to open it.

What should you do when you leave the hospital?
- It is very important to take all of your new heart 
medications. In particular, you are now taking aspirin and 
ticagrelor. These two medications keep the stents in the vessels 
of the heart open and help reduce your risk of having a future 
heart attack. If you stop these medications or miss ___ dose, you 
risk causing a blood clot forming in your heart stents, and you 
may die from a massive heart attack. Please do not stop taking 
either medication without taking to your heart doctor, even if 
another doctor tells you to stop the medications.

- You will be discharged on another blood thinner medication 
called warfarin (also known as Coumadin), this medication will 
need close blood testing monitoring so make sure to follow up 
with the ___ clinic as directed.

- You were discharged on lovenox shots to be taken until 
warfarin has its full effect in your body. You should have your 
blood checked on ___ to see whether warfarin 
reached its adequate effect. Do not stop lovenox until advised 
by the ___ clinic.

- Please make sure to keep all your doctors ___.

- You will need a follow up heart echo within 4 to 6 weeks after 
your leave the hospital.

NEW MEDICATIONS:
Aspirin 81 mg once daily
Ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily
Warfarin 5 mg once daily (dose might be changed by the 
___ clinic)
Lovenox (enoxaparin) shots twice a day
Atorvastatin 80 mg once daily
Carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily
Lisinopril 10 mg daily
Nitro under the tongue as needed for chest pain

It was a pleasure taking care of you.
- Your ___ team
