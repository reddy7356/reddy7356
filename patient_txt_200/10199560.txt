Attending: ___.
 
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Attempted Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation
-Endotracheal Intubation
 
History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ y.o. male with past medical history of MI in ___ 
s/p PTCA at ___ as well as aplastic anemia, DM, and PVD who 
presented on the day of admission with approximately one hour of 
chest pain.  This pain did not start with exertion as the 
patient was just walking around his house when he noticed some 
pain under his sternum.  At first, he thought this was most 
likely heartburn so he took a couple of TUMs and then went to 
lay down for a while.  Unfortunately, after about an hour he was 
continuing to have this pain, which continued at a five out of 
ten level and was beginning to radiate into his right shoulder.  
He was not diaphoretic or short of breath at rest.  He described 
this pain as very similar to his previous cardiac pain but less 
severe.  When the pain did not go away after rest he became 
concerned for a heart problem and called the ambulance to take 
him to this hospital.  

In the ED initial vital signs were 75, 145/84, RR 15, O2 Sat of 
96% on 4L.  He had an EKG which showed possible ST segment 
elevations and T wave inversions in V3-V5 that remained stable 
during his time in the ED.  Initial cardiac enzymes revealed a 
troponin of 0.74 and CPK of 155 and MB of 6.  Other remarkable 
lab values at the time included a Cr of 2.2 (up from his 
baseline of 1.7) and a Platelet count of 101.  He was given 
aspirin, clopidogrel, and started on NTG and heparin gtt.  His 
pain resolved early in his ED course and did not recur.  The 
cardiology fellow was consulted and felt though the patient was 
most likely having an NSTEMI that he did not need urgent cath so 
Mr. ___ was admitted to the ___ service for management with 
early cathterization and revascularization planned in the next 
___ hrs.  Epifibatide was initially held due to concern about 
his thrombocytopenia and bleeding risk.

<b><u>OTHER STUDIES</b></u>
EKG on ___:
Sinus rhythm with Q waves in leads II, III and aVF consistent 
with inferior
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. ST segment coving in 
leads V3- with associated T wave inversions consistent with 
evolving anterior injury
pattern. Multiple ventricular premature beats. No previous 
tracing available for comparison.

CXR on ___:
IMPRESSION: There is diffuse pulmonary edema. There is likely a 
right
pleural effusion possibly a small left pleural effusion. A more 
consolidative process in the right lung base cannot be excluded. 
The heart appears relatively enlarged even accounting for 
patient and technical factors which would represent an acute 
change. Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is 
recommended to assess for underlying infection.

Echocardiogram on ___:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is an inferolateral basal left 
ventricular aneurysm. There is severe regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to distal anterior 
septum, basal inferior and inferolateral segments, severe 
hypokinesis of the remaining segments with sparing of the basal 
septum. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely 
depressed (LVEF= ___ %). Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root 
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There 
is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderately dilated left ventricle with severe 
regional dysfunction consistent with ischemic heart disease 
(multivessel).  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old gentleman with history of coronary artery disease 
s/p MI as well as diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular 
disease, and aplastic anemia presenting with chest pain.  

1) NSTEMI/CAD: Given the patient's multiple risk factors and EKG 
changes he was diagnosed with presumptive ACS on arrival to the 
ED and thus was almost immediately given aspirin and beta 
blocker and started on nitroglycerine.  His pain resolved after 
receiving NTG and never recurred.  He was also started on 
heparin.  After his first set of cardiac enzymes returned 
positive the on-call cardiology fellow was contacted and made 
aware of the patient.  S/he recommended against epifibatide 
given the patient's thrombocytopenia and indicated that the 
patient did not need urgent cathterization.  The patient was 
admitted to the cardiology service with plan for cardiac 
catheterization in the next ___ hours. The patient was then 
transferred to CCU for sustained VT (see below).  Repeat cardiac 
enzymes continued to show flat CK's and echo showed significant 
wall motion abnormalities suggesting this was a subacute 
presentation of a myocardial infarction.  This indicated less 
benefit from immediate catheterization and given development of 
decompensated heart failure and need for intubation (see below) 
as well as acute renal failure the decision was made to postpone 
catheterization until after kidney function had normalized.  The 
patient will also have stress perfusion study prior to 
catheterization as echocardiogram findings are consistent with 
diffuse CAD and this testing could suggest minimal benefit from 
PTCA and drive management toward a surgical strategy.  The 
___ medical regimen for CAD was optimized during this 
hospitalization with addition of aspirin, clopidogrel, and 
statin.  The dose of statin was modified for concurrent 
cyclosporine use.  He will follow up with Dr. ___ in 
cardiology clinic.     

2) Dysrrthymia:  During his first night in the hospital the 
patient had a run of sustained ventricular tachycardia while 
resting comfortably and being monitored on telemetery.  His 
blood pressure decreased from SBP's in the 140's to SBP's in the 
110's, but Mr ___ remained completely asymptomatic during 
this episode.  Given concern this was possibly ischemia related 
VT, he was started on a lidocaine drip with resolution of his VT 
to NSR in a matter of one to two minutes.  He was then 
transferred to the CCU for further management.  In the CCU the 
patient was monitored on telemetry and stayed primarily in NSR 
with occasional incidents of NSVT that decreased in frequency 
over the course of his hospital stay.  He was seen by EP, who 
thought given this was monomorphic VT with history of MI and 
hypo/akinetic apex this was most likely scar mediated VT.  The 
plan was made to do a VT ablation at the same time of cardiac 
catheterization for revascularization.  Cardiac cathterization 
was canceled for the reasons described above but the 
electrophysiology service decided to proceed with the ablation 
and took the patient to the cath lab.  Unfortunately, during 
this procedure after receiving blood products and put in a 
supine position he became quite short of breath and hypoxic and 
was electively intubated for respiratory ditress.  The VT 
ablation was unsuccessful and the patient was managed medically 
from that point forward.  Given the decreased incidence of NSVT 
over the course of his hospitalization the electrophysiology 
service did not recommend continuing anti-arrythmic therapy with 
anything but beta blocker.  

3) Acute Systolic Heart Failure: At the time of presentation the 
patient had crackles to auscultation of his lung bases 
bilaterally and an oxygen requirement. Given presumption of MI 
it was assumed he was in some degree of acute, decompensated 
heart failure and he had a brisk diuresis to a single dose of 
furosemide.  Early in the morning following admission the 
patient had an echocardiogram showing severe LV dysfunction with 
an EF of ___. Despite this, the patient had a stable 
respiratory status over the following day.  He received one unit 
of blood with furosemide given at the same time and continued to 
have good oxygen saturations on a few liters of oxygen by nasal 
cannula.  Unfortunately, the following day after receiving two 
liters of blood in the cath lab and being put in a recumbent 
position the patient had an acutely worsened respiratory status 
and had to be intubated due to respiratory compromise.  He also 
became hypotensive briefly and returned to the CCU from the cath 
lab on small doses of dopamine, which were weaned off over the 
following hours without recurrence of hypotension.  While he was 
intubated he was diuresed approximately two liters, which 
required a furosemide drip after an inadequate response to bolus 
furosemide doses.  After this diuresis he was s extubated 
without incident and continued to self diurese another liter 
without further diuretic therapy.  He maintained approximate 
euvolemia after this without further need for diuretics.  
Regarding chronic medical management of his heart failure, the 
patient was continued on his beta blocker.  ACE inhibitor 
therapy was considered but held due to the patient's acute renal 
failure.  He was started on Hydralazine and Isosorbide as a 
substitute regimen for afterload reduction with plan to start 
ACE inhibitor as an outpatient after renal function has improved 
to baseline.  On discharge the patient has chronic heart failure 
given known reduced EF but was compensated without clinical 
signs of volume overload.          

4) Acute renal failure on Chronic Kidney Disease: On 
presentation the patient's Cr was elevated to 2.2 from baseline 
of 1.6.  Consideration was given to ATN versus poor perfusion 
due to acute decompensated heart failure versus cyclosporine 
toxicity.  Cyclosporine level was found to be undetectable, but 
the first two diagnostic possibilities remained under 
consideration particularly as kidney function did not improve 
with initial heart failure management.  Thus, the nephrology 
service was consulted.  They examined the urinary sediment and 
found no granular casts suggesting ATN.  This led to a 
presumptive diagnosis of prerenal failure due to poor systolic 
function and inadequate perfusion.  As the patient's heart 
failure improved his Cr improved as well and after peaking at 
2.6 it had fallen back to 1.9 at discharge.   

5) Aplastic Anemia: On presentation the patient's hematocrit was 
approximately 27, which is his baseline.  Over the next day, 
however, he fell to 25 and was given three units of blood in the 
hospital due to concern for anemia in the context of inadequate 
coronary perfusion.  After these transfusions his hematocrit 
increased appropriately to 29 but then began to fall to around 
his baseline value of 26 at the time of discharge.  The patient 
was also thrombocytopenic with relatively stable platelet counts 
of 70 to 100 during his hospitalization.  His cyclosporine was 
held in the hospital due to concerns over his acute renal 
failure but restarted at the time of discharge.  He will follow 
up with his regular hematologist, Dr. ___.     

6) Diabetes Mellitus: The patient was maintained on sliding 
scale insulin in the hospital with reasonable control of his 
blood glucose.

7) Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient is status post 
multiple peripheral vascular interventions with multiple bruits 
appreciated on physical exam. Following his attempted 
percutaneous VT ablation he was found to have a cold, pulseless 
left foot that became mottled during the period there was a 
sheath in place.  This exam improved with better color following 
sheath removal but pulses could still not be found with doppler. 
 Vascular surgery was consulted and chose to monitor given no 
signs of active ischemia and over the next day pulse returned 
and at discharge patient's foot at baseline with dopplerable but 
not palpable pulses.  During this hospitalization Mr. ___ was 
started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and statin therapy for his CAD, 
but these medical measures should also help manage his PVD.  

Mr. ___ was fed a cardiac, heart healthy diet in the 
hospital.  He was kept on subcutaneous heparin for DVT 
prophylaxis.  He was full code.

Cardiac Perfusion Persantine ___:
INTERPRETATION:
The image quality is adequate. There is mild soft tissue 
attenuation.
Left ventricular cavity size is markedly enlarged. The EDV is 
299 ml. There is increased ventricular cavity size at stress 
when compared to rest suggesting TID.
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a fixed severe reduction 
in perfusion of the entire inferior wall. There is a fixed 
moderate reduction in perfusion of the mid and basal segments of 
the inferolateral and lateral walls. There is a mild reversible 
reduction in perfusion of the mid and distal anterior septal 
wall.
Gated images reveal global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 20%.
IMPRESSION: 1) Severe, moderate sized fixed defect of the 
inferior wall. 2)
Moderate, large fixed defect of the inferolateral and lateral 
walls. 3) Mild, small reversible defect of the mid and distal 
anterior septum. 4) Global hypokinesis. The ejection fraction is 
20%. 5) TID suggesting multivessel disease. 
.
Stress ___:
INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old type 2 IDDM man with a history 
of
CAD and LVEF of ___ was referred to the lab for evaluation 
following
recent NSTEMI and acute CHF. The patient was referred for a 
functional
study but due to his extremely limited physical ability it was 
converted
to a pharmacologic stress test. He was infused with 0.142 
mg/kg/min of
dipyridamole over 4 minutes. No arm, neck, back or chest 
discomfort was
reported by the patient throughout the study. There were no 
significant
ST segment changes from the baseline abnormalities during the 
infusion
or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated
polymorphic vpbs. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the 
infusion.
The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or significant ST segment 
changes.
Nuclear report sent separately.
.
CXR ___:
FINDINGS: Interval withdrawal of endotracheal tube and NG tube. 
The cardiac
silhouette is enlarged. Low lung volumes. Engorgement of the 
pulmonary
vasculature with bilateral pleural effusions and increased 
interstitial
opacity consistent with moderate pulmonary edema. There is no 
pneumothorax.
Retrocardiac opacity may represent a combination of atelectasis 
and pleural
effusions. A repeat study after appropriate treatment is 
recommended to
exclude pneumonia.
.
EKG on arrival to floor 14:29 demonstrated: Rate 61 rhythm 
sinus, axis normal, QRS 4 boxes same as prior EKG, T wave 
inversions in v1-v6 but more flat in v5-v6 than prior, more 
biphasinin v1 & v2 and QRS morphology different than prior, no 
ST elevations or depression.
.
Repeat EKG 16:09: deeper T waves in v2, v3 and downward Ts in 
v1(were uprightin v1, v2 in ED department) but more consistent 
with T waves from old EKG in ___ when pt had NSTEMI
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Patient is a ___ yo male with PMH CAD, MI in ___ s/p PTCA, 
NSTEMI a few weeks ago, Vtach, aplastic anemia, DM, HTN, severe 
PVD, systolic HF, admitted for SSCP and dyspnea. The pt was 
found to have volume overload on CXR consistent with acute on 
chronic systolic CHF.
.
#. CAD- The patient arrived on the floor with a nitro drip and 
chest pain free.  He was chest pain free for the remained of his 
admission.  He was easily weaned from the nitro drip. His EKGs 
showed no ST elevations or depression.  He did have T wave 
changes in the ED that were inconsistent with his most recent 
EKGs but these reverted back to their previous morphology.  He 
was continued on ___, b-blocker, and atorvastatin.  His 
isosorbide dinitrate was held while on the nitro drip and was 
then restarted. His cardiac enzymes were cycled and his 
troponins were positive peaking at 0.34 but his CK and CKMB were 
negative. He was not considered to have ruled in on the basis of 
these troponins alone.  The patient has severe CAD based on his 
echo and MIBI. His stress test showed no anginal type symptoms 
and no significant ST segment changes.  
His MIBI showed: 
1) a Severe, moderate sized fixed defect of the inferior wall. 
2) Moderate, large fixed defect of the inferolateral and lateral 
walls. 
3) Mild, small reversible defect of the mid and distal anterior 
septum. 
4) Global hypokinesis. His EF was 20%. 5) TID suggesting 
multivessel disease. 
.
He was discharged with close follow up with Dr. ___.  
.
#. Pump - The patient had acute on chronic systolic CHF on 
admission.  His BNP was 58396.  He was diuresed and responded 
well to lasix 40 IV.  His EF was ___ on last admission and 
his stress MIBI during this admission showed an EF of 20%. He 
had no crackles on exam on admission. He was discharged home on 
lasix 20mg PO daily, his home dose of b-blocker, daily weights, 
and a low salt diet.
.
#. Rhythm: He had many episodes of VT at previous admission 
likely secondary to previous myocardial scaring. He had only one 
short run of 4 beats of Vtach on telemetry during this 
admission.  He received substrate modification at his previous 
admission and is not an ICD candidate based on his aplastic 
anemia.
.
# Hyponatremia- His hyponatremia improved slowly during his 
admission 126->129->131->131->135 and was resolved on discharge. 
 His hyponatremia was likely due to hypervolemia and improved

family called EMS for agonal breathing. He was intubated in the 
field and brought to the ED. As he is intubated and sedated, 
history is obtained from the ___ medical record and family.  

In the ED, he was fighting the vent; he had poor peripheral 
access, so a groin line was placed. While placing the groin 
line, no femoral pulse was present and the rhythm on the bedside 
monitor was wide complex. Epinephrine was given via ETT and once 
venous access was obtained, CaCl2, bicarb, and insulin were 
administered. He never received chest compressions, as 
spontaneous circulation returned quickly (<45 seconds, according 
to ED resident). He received kayexalate via OG tube. He is 
receiving 2 units of PRBCs for Hct of 21. Vital signs at the 
time of transfer were afebrile, pulse 120s, SBP 130s-140s,

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
CT A/P: Prelim read:
Limited noncontrast evaluation. Bilateral moderate pleural 
effusions and 
bibasilar consolidations likely representing aspiration in the 
setting of 
recent cardiac/respiratory arrest. Mild free abdominal fluid and 
anasarca. 
Large gallstone. No definite evidence for acute intra-abdominal 
process.

HEAD CT:
No evidence of hemorrhage. Multifocal areas of cortical and 
subcortical hypodensity represent chronic infarct, though 
further evaluation with MRI may be pursued to evaluate for acute 
or subacute components. 
 
ECHo: 
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure 
is ___. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. 
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 
20 %) with akinesis of the inferior, infero-lateral, distal 
LV/apical segments. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased 
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right 
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free 
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus 
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is 
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with multiple medical problems including DM2, CAD, CHF, 
aplastic anemia, CKD, who presented to the ICU s/p respiratory 
and cardiac arrests with hyperkalemia, acute on chronic renal 
failure, and DIC. The exact nature of these events is unclear, 
but he has had worsening renal function over the past week, 
leading to electrolyte disturbances and possibly an 
arrhythmogenic cardiac arrest with spontaneous return of 
circulation prior to the arrival of EMS. On admission, patient 
was intubated, unresponsive, in acute renal failure, liver 
failure and had cardiac damage as evidenced by elevated cardiac 
biomarkers. He was aggressively fluid recussitated, started on 
broad spectrum antibiotics for presumed sepsis, transfused RBC's 
and started on pressors for blood pressure support.  Heme/onc 
was consulted and patient was determined to be in DIC.  Renal 
was consulted and it was determined that renal replacement 
therapy was not indicated.  

Patient was maintained on vent, antibiotics and pressors but 
continued to deteriorate with worsening renal function, no 
improvement in respiratory status, and decreasing blood pressure 
to systolics of 30 in spite of pressor support.  The decision 
was made by his family to make patient comfort measures only.  
He was started on a morphine drip for comfort, extubated and all 
non-comfort medications were discontinued.  He expired on ___ 
at 12:10pm.
