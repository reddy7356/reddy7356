None

 
History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y.o. F with HTN, HLD, anxiety, L.
breast cancer s/p L. axillary and sentinel node dissection +
radiation (___), R. brachial plexus injury at birth who
presents with reported tachycardia and hypotension at her rehab
and is now being admitted on ___ for further evaluation 
of
her tachycardia, hypotension. 

Per EMS, her HR was elevated to 180s, and BP was recorded as
64/52 on ___ at ~1300pm. Per a nurse at her facility (___
Residence @___), her VS an hour later were as follows:
BP 103/70, HR 118. She became hypotensive again overnight to
88/58, with HR 107, and refused VS in the morning. During these
episodes, she complained of weakness, but was otherwise
asymptomatic. The rehab physician was contacted at night and
d/c'ed her diltiazem which had recently been started during a
hospitalization in ___, and started her on digoxin 0.125mg
qd. This morning, pt refused vital signs and she was 
subsequently
sent to the ED for further monitoring of VS. Notably, her son
tells us she has poor fluid intake and he is constantly 
reminding
her to take in more fluids. 

Of note, she was recently admitted to the Neurology service from
___. She was admitted for word-finding difficulty and
transient blank staring, which was thought to be ___ anxiety;
prior to these episodes, she was not filling her prn clonazepam.
Stroke, TIA, and seizure were thought to be less likely, based 
on
w/u. Her hospital course was c/b several long runs of SVT for
which she was initially treated with IV and PO metoprolol, which
were not effective. She was started on diltiazem which was
uptitrated to dilt ER 180mg qd. She was initiated on baby ASA 
and
diltiazem for rate control, and her home statin was discontinued
due concern for interaction with diltiazem.

She reports mild dysuria toward the end of her urinary stream, 
as
well as urinary frequency, but states this is a chronic issue
that has been going on for months. She also endorses
non-productive cough when she does not take her home
anti-histamine. Denies HA, fever, chills, night sweats,
rhinorrhea, sore throat, CP, palpitations, abd pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, cold/heat intolerance, 
episodes
in which she becomes diaphoretic, dysuria, urinary incontinence
or urgency.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y.o. F with HTN, HLD, anxiety, L. 
breast cancer s/p L. axillary and sentinel node dissection 
+radiation (___), R. brachial plexus injury at birth who 
presents with reported hypotension at rehab. She had several 
episodes of supraventricular tachycardia seen on telemetry. The 
patient was asymptomatic during these episodes. She remained 
hemodynamically stable. she was found to be orthostatic. She was 
given IV fluid boluses, which improved orthostatics. She was 
continued on diltiazem 180 mg daily. She tolerated this 
medication well.

#AVNRT 
As above, patient had several episodes of supraventricular 
tachycardia. She was asymptomatic and on the commode at this 
time. Electrophysiology was consulted, who recommended 
continuing diltiazem extended release 180 mg daily. They did not 
recommend any medication changes as the patient was asymptomatic 
during her episodes of SVT. Her blood pressures remained stable. 
We did find that she was taking a first generation antihistamine 
for her allergies, called chlorpheniramine - a Beer's list 
medication that should be avoided in adults over the age of ___ 
due to high risk of anticholinergic toxicity. We told her to 
stop taking this medication.

#Cough
The patient developed a dry cough while inpatient. This was in 
the setting of holding her home allergy medication. It is 
possible that her home allergy medication was contributing to 
her tachycardia (she was taking chlorpheniramine, a Beer's list 
medication that should be avoided in adults over the age of ___ 
due to high risk of anticholinergic toxicity). She was started 
on cetirizine while inpatient and instructed not to take 
chlorpheniramine anymore. The patient refused nasal sprays while 
inpatient.

#Orthostatic hypotension
Patient was found to have very mild orthostatic hypotension. She 
was asymptomatic during the checks. She was given two 500 cc 
boluses of IV fluid. Her orthostatic hypotension resolved. TSH 
was normal. B12 was normal. The patient was encouraged to 
continue to have good p.o. intake.

#UTI
The patient presented with acute on chronic dysuria. UA 
concerning for urinary tract infection. She was given 
ceftriaxone for 3 days from ___.

#Anxiety
Continued home clonazepam 0.5mg bid 

> 30 minutes spent on discharge-related activities today.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
- Cetirizine was started for patient's allergies. She should 
continue taking this medication or another second generation 
antihistamine and avoid taking first generation antihistamines 
due to anticholinergic toxicity.

IMAGING
=======
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS Study Date of ___ 
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for an acute intracranial abnormality.  MRI would 
be more 
sensitive for an acute infarction, if clinically warranted. 
2. Approximately 10% bilateral proximal internal carotid 
stenosis by NASCET criteria.  Tortuous cervical internal carotid 
arteries. 
3. Moderate stenosis at the origin of the dominant left 
vertebral artery. 
4. Calcified plaque within bilateral carotid siphons and V4 
segment of the 
left vertebral artery without evidence for flow-limiting 
stenosis.  No 
evidence for flow-limiting stenosis in the major intracranial 
arteries. 
5. Paranasal sinus disease.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of ___  
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarction, hemorrhage, edema or mass. 
2. Supratentorial white matter changes are nonspecific but 
likely sequela of microvascular ischemic disease. 

EEG Study Date of ___ 
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU EEG monitoring 
study due to 
initially mild background slowing in the 7 Hz range, indicative 
of a mild 
encephalopathy. This improves through the course of the 
recording and by the end, a normal ___ Hz alpha frequency 
posterior dominant rhythm is noted. Excessive beta fast activity 
may be due to a medication effect (e.g. benzodiazepines). There 
are no epileptiform discharges or seizures.

TTE ___
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular wall thicknesses, cavity sizes, 
and regional/global systolic function. Mild pulmonary 
hypertension. No definite structural cardiac source of embolism 
identified. No prior TTE available for comparison.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old left handed woman with history 
of breast cancer status post resection and radiation therapy, 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and anxiety whom presented for 
evaluation of 3 day history of word finding difficulty and two 
events where she had blank staring and became unresponsive. She 
was ruled out for seizure or acute stroke, course complicated by 
AVNRT.

#Anxiety related word finding difficulty: 
Developed word finding difficulty, transient blank staring. 
Admitted to the Neurologic ICU from ___, not principally 
because of neurologic dysfunction but because of difficult to 
control sinus tachycardia as below. Presentation initially 
concerning for both stroke and seizure. Pertinently, has history 
of anxiety and had not been able to take her clonazepam for 3 
days because of inability to fill prescription, this is most 
likely cause of her symptoms. MRI brain without evidence of 
acute or subacute stroke and CVEEG reading normal, without 
slowing or abnormal discharges. Although TIA remains on the 
differential, it is less likely. Risk factors notable for HgA1C 
5.7, LDL 79. TTE with EF 55-100%, no source of embolism 
identified. Discontinued home simvastatin given interaction with 
diltiazem and age. Continued home clonazepam. Intiated aspirin. 
Neurologic exam normal at time of discharge. 

#AVNRT:
Course complicated by several long runs of SVT during admission. 
Initially treated with metoprolol PO and IV, not effective. 
Responded well to diltiazem 10 mg IV and therefore she was 
started on diltiazem 30 mg Q6H, uptitrated to 180 mg daily 
extended release. Continued to have a few runs with HR up to 
160s max 30 min, remained asymptomatic in these episodes. Will 
follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
[] continue to monitor for symptomatic tachycardia, adjust 
diltiazem PRN, consider ablation if pharmacologic interventions 
unsuccessful
[] per discussion with HCP, opted to discontinue tramadol to 
avoid sedative effect, patient was without any pain during 
admission off this medication
[] discontinued home statin, tramadol, atenolol
[] initiated aspirin, diltiazem 
 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY 
2. Simvastatin 20 mg PO QPM 
3. TraMADol 50 mg PO DAILY 
4. ClonazePAM 0.5 mg PO BID PRN anxiety 

 
Discharge Medications:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg PO DAILY  
2.  Diltiazem Extended-Release 180 mg PO DAILY  
3.  ClonazePAM 0.5 mg PO BID PRN anxiety

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure to care for you at the ___ 
___. 

You came to the hospital because you developed blank staring and 
difficulty with speech. We evaluated you for seizures and stroke 
and found that you did not have either of these. We believe you 
presentation may be related to not taking your clonazepam for 
several days. While you were in the hospital, your heart rate 
was very fast and we started you on a new medication called 
"diltiazem" to better control your fast heart, this will replace 
your "atenolol".

Please continue to take your medications as prescribed and 
follow-up with your doctors as ___.

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ care team
