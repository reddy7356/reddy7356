History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/ longstanding Crohn's disease 
complicated by stricturing with recurrent small bowel 
obstructions and perirectal abscess disease. 

He has had multiple abdominal surgeries, including one for 
obstruction, he has a past medical history of Afib (now SR s/p 
ablation) and prostate cancer s/p radical prostatectomy. He is 
on mesalanie for his Crohn's and has had relatively good control 
despite numerous complications of ___ abscess requiring 
drainage and strictures requiring dilations. His most recent
colonoscopy on ___ showed a stricture in the neoterminal 
ileum about 10cm from the anastomosis to colon. There were 
ulcerations in the stricture and around it. There was narrowing 
at the anastomosis. He has anastomosis of the colon and small 
bowel at about 55 cm. He has a history of colovesicular fistula 
as well.

Today he presents as a transfer from OSH. He noticed distention 
on the evening of ___ with subsequent episodes of bilious and 
feculent emesis. Reports formed stools until ___ AM which was 
his last stool. No blood, no melena. No flatus since then.  
Denies fevers, chills and night sweats.  OSH CTAP shows proximal 
dilation to the the jejunum. Some fecalization of the distal
ileum and transition point likely in the right pelvis.  Most 
recent visit on ___ to ED  for partial self resolved SBO. He 
underwent ablation procedure for his atrial fibrillation and 
patient reports he has been in sinus rhythm since the procedure.

MICROBIOLOGY: 
Blood culture neg x 2

IMAGING: 
___ RUQ ULTRASOUND:
IMPRESSION: No gallstones or CBD dilation.  No acute process 
identified.

___ CXR PORTABLE 
Large areas of consolidation have developed in both lower lungs, 
at of
proportion to the extent of mild pulmonary edema present 
elsewhere.  Findings
suggest severe bilateral pneumonia and secondary heart failure.  
Small to
moderate left pleural effusion is likely.  Heart size is 
partially obscured,
but no more than moderately enlarged.  No pneumothorax.
 
___ MRE 
1. Limited study due to motion artifact.
2.  Continued dilated loops of small bowel in the right 
mid-abdomen, less
pronounced than on the prior study, with likely transition point 
in a cluster
of small bowel loops tethered in the low mid abdomen suggestive 
of a partial
small bowel obstruction.  Identifying a discrete transition 
point, however, is
difficult on this exam.  Additionally, these small bowel loops 
in the mid
anterior abdomen appear to demonstrate slightly thickened and 
hyper enhancing
walls suggestive of mild active inflammation.
3.   Mild mucosal hyperenhancement at the neoterminal ileum 
suggests mild
active inflammation but no evidence of post-stenotic dilation or 
obstruction.
4. Transsphincteric fistula extending from 1 o'clock to the left 
anterior
scrotum is incompletely assessed.
5.  The previously seen right perianal fistula is difficult to 
see on today's
MRI.
6.  Mild mucosal hyperemia involving the rectum compatible with 
proctitis
which is likely related to active inflammatory bowel disease.
 
___ TTE 
The left atrial volume index is normal. The interatrial septum 
is aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is 
seen. There is moderate to severe pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic 
function. Moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate 
to severe pulmonary hypertension. 

___ CXR PORTABLE 
Since the prior radiograph of 2 days earlier, pulmonary edema 
has decreased in
severity and bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size. 
 There
remains more confluent opacification at the lung bases, which 
could be due to
dependent edema or a secondary process such as aspiration 
pneumonia.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ yo M with Crohn's disease complicated by 
structuring with recurrent small bowel obstructions. 

#Small bowel obstruction: On ___ he presented to an outside 
hospital with abdominal pain, distention, and emesis. His labs 
were notable for a lipase of 803. He was made NPO given IV 
fluids and admitted to the floor for abdominal exams and 
hemodynamic monitoring. CTAP at OSH showed proximal dilation to 
the jejunum and fecalization of the distal ileum and transition 
point likely in the right pelvis. RUQ U/S showed no gallstones 
or CBD dilation, and no acute process identified. He was 
subsequently admitted to the Surgical service. He was treated 
conservatively for SBO with bowel rest, IVF. He improved and his 
diet was slowly advanced. Pain resolved and pt was having 
regular bowel movements at time of discharge. 

#Aspiration pneumonia/hypoxia: Of note, in the ED had witnessed 
aspiration of vomit when NG tube placement was attempted. During 
hospital course he developed pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea 
and on ___ chest xray showed bibasilar consolidations 
concerning for PNA in addition to e/o pulm edema. ECG showed 
sinus rhythm no acute ischemic changes. Trop neg x 2. Started on 
levaquin for aspiration PNA and transferred to medicine for 
further management. Briefly required supplemental O2 and was 
diuresed with IV Lasix and breathing improved. TTE showed normal 
systolic function but moderated to severe pulmonary HTN with 
PASP estimated at 58 mmhg. Discharged home with close PCP ___ 
and cardiology ___. 

#Acute diastolic heart failure: Pulmonary edema seen on CXR in 
addition to severe bibasilar pneumonia, no known history of 
heart failure. Endorsed orthopnea, no lower extremity edema. 
proBNP 3173, TTE with normal systolic function, elevated TR 
gradient. Trop neg x 2, ECG showed sinus rhythm no acute 
ischemic changes. Briefly required supplemental O2 and was 
diuresed with IV Lasix and dyspnea and hypoxia improved. Was not 
started on standing diuretic on discharge, to ___ with 
cardiology.

#Crohn's disease: complicated by stricturing w/ recurrent small 
bowel obstructions and perirectal abscess disease s/p multiple 
abdominal surgeries. Continued on home mesalamine for 
maintenance therapy. Obtained MRE this admission. The study was 
limited due to motion artifact but showed partial SBO, with 
several areas of mild active bowel inflammation. Discharged with 
close GI ___. 

Chronic Problems: 
#Atrial fibrillation: S/p ablation. continued ASA 81mg daily

#HTN: continued lisinopril 30mg daily
