ED and in addition to heparin, they recommended elevation and 
compression wrappings of the legs to aid in reduction of 
swelling.  Through discussion with her outpatient providers and

was an issue in this paitient.  It was felt that she could not 
be safely discharged with a lovenox bridge and so she was kept

======================
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with ___ disease who 
presented with failure to thrive, weakness, and feeling "lost" 
at home. A metabolic and infectious workup were negative. 
Neurology evaluated the patient and felt her presentation was 
consistent with the progression of ___. Physical 
therapy, occupational therapy, nutrition, and speech and swallow 
evaluated the patient to help create a plan for safety at home. 
While rehab was recommended, given the patient has good family 
support at home and family is eager to take her home, ___ and OT 
educated them on how to care for her at home. She was discharged 
home with services and follow up with neurology.

ACUTE ISSUES
============
# FAILURE TO THRIVE
# WEAKNESS
# ___ DISEASE
Ms. ___ presented with vague symptoms of feeling weak, 
unwell, and "lost." Her neurologic symptoms are consistent with 
how we expect ___ Disease to progress. She is also 
likely deconditioned, and physical therapy and occupational 
therapy worked with the patient and her son to train them on 
skills needed to care for her properly at home. While they 
recommended discharge to rehab, the patient and her family 
preferred going home after training and with services. We also 
did a nutritional workup, and labs that have come back have all 
been within normal limits. Neurology evaluated the patient and 
determined no acute interventions were indicated at this time. 

# IATROGENIC HYPERTHYROIDISM
# MULTINODULAR GOITER
Ms. ___ was also found to have hyperthyroidism, which may be 
contributing to her anxiety and failure to thrive. Her 
levothyroxine was held during her admission. 

# LEUKOPENIA
WBC 3.8 on admission and downtrended slightly during her 
admission. No clear etiology and no evidence of infection. 
Thought to be secondary to her olanzapine.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Levothyroxine was held because TSH/T4 showed hyperthyroidism. 
We recommend retesting TSH/T4 in the outpatient setting and 
restarting levothyroxine, potentially at a lower dose first, as 
appropriate.
[] Our physical and occupational therapists recommended a 
discharge to rehab but the patient and her son were strongly in 
favor of going home with training and services. Ms. ___ may 
require ___ rehabilitation in the future if she continues 
to have functional decline. 
[] Ms. ___ is currently taking olanzapine 5mg nightly to 
help with weight gain and anxiety. According to a neurology note 
from ___, there was consideration to uptitrate this medication, 
which the patient may benefit from.
[] Speech and swallow recommended a video swallow study in the 
outpatient setting.
[] Consider switching from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine at 
future outpatient visits per neurology.
