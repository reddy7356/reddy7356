Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted for mid-low back pain similar to 
prior chronic pain secondary to spasms from her T6 paraplegia.  
She felt her pain was similar to the pain she gets with urinary 
tract infections; her UA was mildly positive with positive 
nitrites and 5 WBCs.  We initiated treatment with ciprofloxacin; 
on day of discharge her urine culture prior to antibiotic 
administration grew out <10,000 colonies.  Urine sensitivities 
were pending at time of discharge.  We did not feel there was 
significant evidence for treatment of urinary tract infection 
although given her history we are completing a short, three day 
course to prevent development of resistance.  She was scheduled 
for follow up with her primary care doctor.  We continued her 
pain control with percocet as well as her baclofen and neurontin 
for her muscle spasms.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___, 

You were admitted for worsening pain and a urinary tract 
infection.  We started you on ciprofloxacin to treat this 
infection.  You will need to continue this for one more day.  We 
are waiting for your urine tests to come back to figure out if 
cipro is working for you.  If we find that you are growing 
bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, we will be in touch with 
you to recommend changes in your antibiotics.  If you develop 
worsening fevers, pain, or difficulty/pain urinating, please 
call your primary care doctor or return to the emergency 
department. 
.
The only medication change we are making is starting you on 
ciprofloxacin.  You should continue this for one more day.
