Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have right femoral neck fracture and was admitted to the 
orthopedic surgery service. The patient was taken to the 
operating room on ___ for right hip hemiarthroplasty, which 
the patient tolerated well. For full details of the procedure 
please see the separately dictated operative report. The patient 
was taken from the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after 
satisfactory recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the 
floor. The patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain 
medications, and progressed to a regular diet and oral 
medications by POD#1. The patient was given ___ 
antibiotics and anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home 
medications were continued throughout this hospitalization. The 
patient worked with ___ who determined that discharge to rehab 
was appropriate. The ___ hospital course was otherwise 
remarkable for low UOP requiring fluid bolus, a urinary tract 
infection, and asymptomatic atrial tacchycardia indicative of 
possible wandering pacemaker.  Aspiration precautions were in 
place, but patient tolerated mechanical soft/nectar thickened 
liquids without concern.  Should have a speech and swallow 
evaluation as an outpatient.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is 
weightbearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity, and 
will be discharged on lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient 
will follow up with Dr. ___ routine. A thorough 
discussion was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and 
expected post-discharge course including reasons to call the 
office or return to the hospital, and all questions were 
answered. The patient was also given written instructions 
concerning precautionary instructions and the appropriate 
follow-up care. The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

Micro: None

Imaging:
CTA: 1.  Large sigmoid bleed with colonic diverticulosis.  This 
is likely a diverticular bleed. 
2.  Diffusely thickened urinary bladder wall is likely 
predominantly due to decompression from Foley catheter but 
please correlate with symptoms of
cystitis or results of cystoscopy.   
3.  Small free pelvic fluid is nonhemorrhagic but not 
physiologic in a 
postmenopausal female.   
4.  Small layering stones or sludge within the gallbladder with 
two 1.3 cm rounded densities in the common bile duct.  These 
likely represent CBD stones or sludge and are associated with 
CBD dilatation and moderate intrahepatic bile duct dilatation.

dementia and risk of GIB. Lisinopril 20 MG DAILY and Amlodipine 
2.5 MG daily were restarted when bleed ceased.
