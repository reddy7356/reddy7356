TID with Oxycodone 30mg q3h. In the days since, he called in 
with
worsening pain, likely ___ widespread bony metastases seen on 
MRI
Spine from early ___. Dr ___ admission but 
patient
declined so increased PO oxycodone to 60mg as needed. In clinic
this afternoon patient was in intractable pain so Dr ___ admission and patient was in agreement. As per Dr
___ will not be offered further chemotherapy, 
and
should transition to hospice if in agreement, with radiation to
spine for palliation of symptoms. Radiation oncology evaluated
patient and are to start radiation tomorrow

Pt reports that since last discharge he has had left leg pain
which is posterior and then travels across his lower back,
occasionally with right posterior leg pain as well. He noted 
that
it comes and goes without clear provoking factors, possibly
movement makes it worse. He noted that when he was discharged 
the
30mg oxycodone was insufficient, but that 60mg oxycodone worked
for a short period of time until today. He noted that intensity
continues to escalate and today was ___ or more. He noted that
the location/sharp quality of pain and associated right lower
extremity weakness is unchanged. He stated that 2mg of IV
dilaudid in clinic did not help but 4mg IV dilaudid immediately
resolved his pain, and is now ___.

He noted that given his overall worsening function, and fact 
that
further chemotherapy will not be offered, noted that he would 
not
want extremely aggressive measures pursued such as surgery. He
stated that he does not want to increase his steroid dose as it
caused significant thrush in the past. He noted that his goal
would be to have better symptom control with radiation and
augmented pain regimen so that he could return home. He noted
that he would be open to considering hospice but would like to
talk to his wife first.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old gentleman with COPD, metastatic 
NSCLC (significant bony disease, now transitioning off of 
treatment), acute on chronic malignant back pain, PE/DVT, who 
presented from clinic with intractable back pain for pain
control, now transitioned to methadone and increased frequency 
of oxycodone. 

#Acute on Chronic Malignant Back Pain
Patient with stable right leg weakness in last month but 
escalating intensity of posterior thigh and lower back pain. 
Etiology likely due to extensive metastatic lesions noted on 
recent MRI from 2 weeks ago. No cord compression was seen on 
that
MRI, and right leg weakness and hesitancy with urination is 
unchanged for 1 month without any new fecal incontinence so 
cauda equina unlikely. Moreover patient clearly states that he 
would not want any surgical intervention. He was started on 
palliative radiation therapy. With the assistance of palliative 
care patient's ms contin was transitioned to methadone, his prn 
oxycodone was increased in frequency and he was started on low 
dose gabapentin. His QTc remained under 400ms, he had mild 
confusion on the day of initiation that cleared. Dexamethasone 
was left at 2mg to avoid him from having further episodes of 
candidal stomatitis. 

#Opioid induced constipation: Patient experienced severe 
constipation which responded to polyethyleneglycol 17g bid, 
bisacodyl 10mg qod and magnesium citrate 300mL PRN. 

___ stomatitis: Did not respond to initial treatment with 
nystatin. Received fluconazole for 5 days with resolution. 

#PE/DVT: Previously on enoxaparin, at the request of  Dr. 
___ was transitioned to rivaroxaban.

#Metastatic Lung Cancer: During admission patient and family had 
meeting with Dr. ___ it was communicated that no 
other chemotherapy options were available at the time. Plan is 
to transition to hospice once he completes radiation treatmen.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=====================
#PAIN REGIMEN:
-Discharged with 3-day (48 x 30mg oxycodone tablets) supply, 
prior authorization submitted by outpatient team and pending at 
time of discharge, patient given physical prescription and list 
of pharmacies with supply
-Please uptitrate methadone as needed, continue to monitor QTc
-Uptitrated bowel regimen to miralax 17g bid, bisacodyl 10mg 
qod, responded well to magnesium citrate in house, consider 
repeating if needed
-Started on gabapentin 100mg tid, previously was somnolent with 
200mg, may consider careful uptitration
#RADIATION TREATMENTS: Arranged for radiation treatments to 
resume on ___

This patient's discharge plan took 120 minutes to formulate and 
coordinate.

ADMISSION BRAIN MRI
Multiple enhancing intracranial lesions involving both cerebral 
cortices are highly concerning for metastatic disease. Largest 
lesions located in the left frontal and right temporal lobe 
measuring 1.5 x 1.4 and 2.1 x 1.9 cm, respectively. The lesion 
in the right temporal lobe demonstrates 
susceptibility artifact, likely reflecting prior hemorrhage. 
There is 
extensive vasogenic edema causing on the right lateral 
ventricle. In 
addition, there is mild approximately 4 mm of midline shift to 
the left. 
.
ADMISSON CXR: - Images reviewed by author
There is a relatively rounded opacity projecting over the right 
middle lobe measuring approximately 2.5 cm also seen on the 
lateral view.  Streaky opacities also noted in the infrahilar 
region on the right behind the heart, potentially in the 
retrocardiac region on the lateral view.  The lungs are 
hyperinflated but otherwise grossly clear.  Cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is within normal limits.  Anterior cervical fixation 
hardware is noted. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
A 2.5 right middle lobe nodule and irregular right infrahilar 
opacities likely within the right lower lobe.  If patient has 
symptoms for infection, follow-up could be obtained after 
treatment to document resolution however if no convincing 
evidence of infection at this time, this could represent an 
underlying primary malignancy and CT scan is suggested at this 
time on a nonurgent basis. 

CT chest ___:
 
5 lung nodules ranging from 6 mm to 2.5 cm in diameter.  Any one 
of these 
could be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma, but the number 
suggests metastases 
from an extrathoracic primary malignancy.  The large right lower 
lobe nodule 
should be accessible to transthoracic needle aspiration.  
Probable right hilar 
adenopathy due to local spread of the lower lobe lesion. 
  
Mild emphysema, diffuse small airway inflammation and probable 
respiratory 
bronchiolitis all due to tobacco use. 
  
Mild coronary atherosclerosis. 

CT abdomen/pelvis ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. Omental fat stranding and diffuse mild mental thickening, 
without masses, 
likely represents metastatic disease. 
2. A 1.3 cm hypodensity with peripheral enhancement in segment 
II of the liver 
likely represents a hemangioma. 
3. A 2.5 cm fluid collection in the right inguinal region at the 
site of prior 
hernia repair is consistent with seroma. 
4. Please refer to separate report of CT chest performed same 
day for 
description of thoracic findings.

was afebrile and hemodynamically stable but with sinus 
bradycardia. MRI brain showed multiple enhancing intracranial 
lesions involving both cerebral cortices highly concerning for 
metastatic disease and c/b vasogenic edema and midline shift to 
the left.  Admitted to medicine where he was managed with PO 
dexamethasoneand prophylactic po levetiracetam following IV 
loads as well as home PO oxycodone and IV PRN hydromorphone for 
pain control.  Underwent CT chest which was notable for 5 lung 
nodules ranging from 6 mm to 2.5 cm in diameter any one of which 
could be a primary bronchogenic carcinoma, but the number could 
suggests metastases from an extrathoracic primary malignancy.  
CT abd/pelvis did not show obvious primary but did show omental 
fat stranding and diffuse mild omental thickening, without 
masses, but which likely represent metastatic disease. Underwent 
___ guided biopsy of right pulmonary nodule on ___ which he 
tolerated well. Cytology of brushing was negative for malignant 
cells and biopsy results are pending at discharge. Patient was 
reviewed by oncology who provided guidance about their plan for 
ongoing post d/c follow-up and their contact details.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to ___ with leg swelling and shortness of 
breath. You were found to have a blood clot in your left leg and 
both lungs. You were started on a blood thinner called lovenox 
to treat this and prevent future blood clots. Please continue to 
take this. 

Your pain regimen was also increased so that you can take up to 
30mg of oxycodone every 4 hours as needed for pain. You will 
also be taking the long-acting MS ___ three times a day 
instead of twice a day. We have confirmed with your pharmacy 
that these changes will not be too expensive, but please notify 
your primary medical team immediately if you are having any 
issues obtaining your medications. Lastly, you will need to stop 
taking Celebrex (celecoxib) because it interacts with Lovenox. 

Please follow up with all appointments as listed below.  

It was a pleasure taking care of you, 
Your ___ Oncology Team 
 
Followup Instructions:
___
