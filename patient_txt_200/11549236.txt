History of Present Illness:
Patient is a ___ yo RHW with hx of traumatic SDH back in ___
but did not undergo any surgical intervention transferred from
___ after ~45 minutes of generalized convulsion. 


Patient fell back in ___ while carrying laundry basket - 
thought
to have tripped over something and found to have L SDH.  She was
admitted here from ___ ~ ___ under ___ service but did not
have surgical intervention.  She was discharged to home with
Dilantin then she was found to have some word-finding difficulty
on ___ hence was admitted to ___ from ___.  She was
initially sent to rehab and she has been home afterwards and per
sister, she has been getting stronger day by day.  She was
actually able to take a lengthy walk with sister who held her
hand yesterday and was in her USOH this morning.  

Then around 1pm, patient was found in the bathroom calling for
her sister.  Per sister, patient was shaking her head and arms
with L hand clenched but was able to talk to her sister.  
Patient
was also quite diaphoretic per sister.  EMS was called and
patient was able to answer their questions but upon arrival to
___, she was reportedly having generalized
convulsion.  The ambulance that took her was not equipped to 
give
her any meds.  At ___, she was given 30mg IV
Valium then 4mg of IV Ativan and intubated after a bolus of
Propofol.  Her convulsion supposedly lasted ~45 minutes.  She
then was transferred here for further evaluation.  Also, she was

seizures per sister but it appears that her Dilantin dose was
increased from ___ to ___ at ___.

ROS completely negative per sister including fever/chills, 
change
in appetite, N/V/D, or sick contact.

Given the fever of 101 and status, patient was empirically

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is an ___ year old right handed woman with a history 
of a traumatic left subdural hematoma on ___ who presented with 
suspected status epilepticus while on Dilantin.

# Neuro/Seizures/Subdural Hematoma:  The patient was admitted 
intubated and sedated in the setting of a possible seizure and 
transferred to ___.   On arrival to ICU, CT of the head 
demonstrated resolution of her prior SHD but a new, small right 
sided SDH.  Since her apparent seizure events occurred while on 
dilantin, the patient was loaded with 500mg fosphenytoin and her 
daily dose of dilantin was increased to ___.  With this 
treatment, her seizures resolved and she was successfully 
extubated.  Her dilantin level returned as 13.8.  She markedly 
improved and was transferred to a neuromedicine floor on HD2.  
Her MS examination was remarkable for being alert, oriented to 
place, time and person.  She was attentive, had no neglect. Her 
naming was intact.  Her registration was intact, recall ___.  

She was continued on dilantin at above dosing.  Dilantin level 
at time of discharge was 17.7.  Although she remained seizure 
free, she had signficant difficulties with balance and gait 
(likely due to peripheral neuropathy and cerebellar 
dysfunction).  Because of this, her age and prior falls and gait 
instability, the plan is to wean her off dilantin and 
crostitrate with Keppra. She was started on 250mg BID of Keppra 
which is to be increased by 250mg in each dose every five days 
to maximum dose of 1g bid.  At dose of 750mg BID, her dilantin 
is to be tapered at by 100mg TID and then discontinued once 
dosing of Keppra reaches 1g BID. She will require neurology 
follow up for this.

Given significant clinical improvement, she was discharged home 
with Neurosurtery and Neurology follow up.   

# Cervical Spine Evlauation:   Because of her history of 
traumatic SDH, a CT of the C-spine was conducted.  No fracture 
was seen and the patient was cleared by neurosurgery.

# Cardiovascular/? NSTEMI: The patient had no documented history 
of coronary artery disease but was noted to have an elevated 
troponin on admission.  Admission EKG demonstrated NSR w/ Left 
atrial abnormality, PAC and telemetry monitoring in the ICU was 
unremarkable.   Repeat EKG was notable for no change.  She did 
have troponin elevations but her CKMB was wnl.   

# Hypothyroidism.  TSH was elevated and her T4 was low.  She had 
sx of paresthesias and numbness in her extremities. There were 
no other signs of hypothyroidism.  It is known that phenytoin 
can decrese circulating levels of T4, however, given her 
symptoms, levothyroxine was increased to 100mcg daily.  Her PCP 
office was contacted regarding this and requirement for further 
work up of peripheral neuropathy (we will send B12, Folate, RPR, 
UPEP/SPEP, LFTs, A1C, Lyme antibody).   

# Hyperkalemia.  K was noted to be 5.1 on day of discharge. Pt. 
was asymptomatic.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Right subdural hematoma, Status epilepticus
Secondary: Peripheral neuropathy, Subdural hematoma

 
Discharge Condition:
Seizure free

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ from another hospital for treatment 
of a prolonged seizure.  It was found that your seizure was due 
to a new subdural hematoma (bleed) on your right side.  This was 
felt to due to a possible fall you experienced.  Fortunately, 
the hematoma on your left side has actually improved.

Because of unresponsiveness to dilantin initially, and ongoing 
seizures, you required sedation and temporary intubation.  With 
this 
her seizures were controlled.  Dilantin dosing was increased and 
you were started on Keppra.

Because of you balance difficulties, you will require 
rehabilitation and will require outpatient evaluation for 
peripheral neuropathy.

The following changes were made to you medications:
- Dilantin doses changed to 100mg/200mg/200mg with breakfast, 
lunch and dinner
- Started on Keppra 250mg twice daily to be increased every five 
days.
- Increased levothyroxine to 100micrograms daily

Should your symptoms worsen, you develop confusion, headache, 
vision changes, difficulty with movements, worsening numbness in 
the legs or arms, chest pain or shortness of breath or any other 
symptom concerning to you, please call your primary care doctor 
or go to the emergency room.
