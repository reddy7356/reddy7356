K-4.0 Cl-105 HCO3-27 AnGap-___ year old male with history of dementia, alcohol abuse, HTN, 
chronic kidney disease and frequent syncopal events was brought 
in by EMS from ___ for an episode of 
unresponsiveness.  No evidence of shaking movements or eye 
deviation that would suggest seizure.  

Patient was seen in the ED on ___ by Neurology who did not 
think this was TIA/CVA. There were no focal neurological 
deficits present. Ct Scan of head revealed no acute 
abnormalities. This is unlikely to be due to an infectious 
etiology; patient afebrile, no increased WBC count. Urinalysis 
and Chest Xray were clear.  Patient remained on telemetry 
overnight and an EKG revealed sinus bradycardia. There were no 
abnormal findings on telemetry overnight including no 
arrythmias. Orthostatic blood pressures from lying down to 
sitting were found to be normal.  Due to bradycardia, patients 
metoprolol was switched from 50mg bid to 25mg bid.  Patient had 
a Cr of 1.6 upon admission, and had decreased to 1.4 after IV 
fluids. The patient has a history of kidney injury with an 
unclear baseline. Likely a component of orthostatic hypotension 
from dehydration contributing to the inciting event.

Chronic Issues:
#Delirium,Dementia: continued reorientation, trazodone prn 
anxiety
#Gout: Continued allopurinol
#HTN: Continue home meds. Decreased dose of metoprolol due to 
bradycardia 

Transitional Issues

#Contact: ___ ___, home 
___
# Encourage fluid intake 
# Unclear what baseline Cr and Heart function is. Please follow 
up as an outpatient
# If syncopal issues continue to occur, patient would benefit 
from event monioring/ ___ of Hearts
# Decreased dose of Metoprolol from 50mg to 25mg POqd due to 
bradycardia
