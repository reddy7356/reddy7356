History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with hx of diffuse large 
B cell lymphoma (s/p 6 cycles R-CHOP) and MGUS (IgG Kappa, SPEP 
6%) who initially presented to ___ on ___ after a 
foreign body became lodged in his esophagus. He was eating steak 
at around 4.30pm that day and suddenly developed difficulty 
swallowing. He also reports that he started coughing shortly 
after, and produced somewhere between a teaspoon - tablespoon of 
blood. The patient has had ___ years of dysphagia, including 
multiple esophageal foreign bodies in the past and is s/p 2x 
esophageal dilatations approximately 5 and ___ years ago 
(diagnosis unclear). At the OSH they deferred bronchoscopy 
because the patient was found to be neutropenic. At that time 
they recommended transfer to ___. 

In the ED at ___, the patient was stable but having some 
difficulty tolerating his oral secretions, however this passed 
spontaneously. The patient was nevertheless admitted to ___ 
because of his neutropenia of unclear etiology.

The patient was seen in ___ clinic on ___. His PET CT 
in ___ revealed no FDG-avid lymphadenopathy but did reveal 
increased uptake in the prostate. A PSA level was drawn but not 
elevated. He was noted at that time to have a persistently 
elevated MCV and relative neutropenia and monocytosis concerning 
for an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome. At a follow up visit 
on ___ he was found to have worsening leukopenia (WBC 1.7 
with 15% neutrophils) and persistently elevated MCV (111-115). A 
bone marrow biopsy was performed at that time.

========== IMAGING STUDIES ==========

CHEST XRAY PA & LATERAL (___):
Minimal left basilar atelectasis. No radiopaque foreign bodies.

BARIUM SWALLOW (___):
A small to moderate-sized hiatal hernia, similar to the prior 
examination, otherwise normal esophagram. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with hx of diffuse large B 
cell lymphoma s/p 6 cycles of R-CHOP (last cycle ended ___ 
and MGUS who presented to ___ ED with dysphagia arising in the 
setting of neutropenia of unclear origin.

# Dysphagia: Arose while eating steak. Pt admits that he eats 
too quickly and does not chew his food sufficiently, likely 
contributing. Furthermore, the patient has a history of chronic 
dysphagia s/p 2 prior esophageal dilatations. The patient's 
current episode of acute dysphagia self-resolved prior to being 
transferred to the floor. A barium swallow was performed and was 
normal except for a small hiatal hernia. Speech and swallow 
evaluation revealed no barriers to resuming a normal diet.

# Neutropenia: Cause of the patient's neutropenia is unclear - 
delayed rituximab toxicity vs myelodysplastic syndrome vs 
drug-induced myelosuppresion. Bone marrow biopsy performed on 
___ as an outpatient, results pending. Continued prophylactic 
acyclovir while inpatient but held Bactrim due to considerable 
risk of myelosuppresion from this drug. Administered 1 dose of 
neupogen prior to discharge and prescribed 10 days of Augmentin 
as prophylaxis due to the medium-large ulcer on the left lateral 
surface of his tongue as well as his history of small volume 
hemoptysis (suspicion for minor esophageal mucosal tear).

# Paroxysmal A-Fib / Prior TIA: The patient's home rivaroxaban, 
metoprolol and flecainide were continued during his 
hospitalization and he was discharged on all of these 
medications. No episodes of symptomatic A-Fib observed during 
his stay. Not placed on telemetry at any point during his stay.

========== TRANSITIONAL ISSUES ==========

# Neutropenia: The patient will require close follow up 
regarding management of his neutropenia. Bone marrow biopsy 
results pending. Patient is to see Dr. ___ in clinic on 
___.
