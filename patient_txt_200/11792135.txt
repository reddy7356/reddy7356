admitted to ___ three weeks ago for laparoscopic hernia repair
with mesh.  She did well postoperatively, although she does have
a shallow non-healing wound on her abdomen at one of the 
incision
sites, which appeared stable and non-infected when Dr. ___
her in clinic one week ago.

Patient was in her usual state of health until yesterday ___,
when she ate a casserole at 2 p.m.  Immediately afterwards, she
began experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and non-bloody
non-bilious vomiting.  She was vomiting every five minutes for
about four hours.  She also began to have watery non-bloody
diarrhea.  In addition, she felt intermittent fevers and chills
associated with the vomiting.  Abdominal pain was constant and
did not get better after vomiting.  She presented to the ED at 
an
OSH, and while in the waiting room, she began to feel better. 
She was able to drink a bottle of water and urinate well, so she
decided to go home.  She started eating the BRAT diet that
evening, tolerating it without difficulty.  However, she woke up
at 4 a.m. today ___ and had severe abdominal pain and vomiting
again.  She decided to come to the ___ ED.

Of note, patient has not urinated yet today, and she saw stars
and felt faint this morning while walking around (but did not
pass out).

1. The patient has had interval repair of an umbilical hernia. 
There is now a fluid collection in the subcutaneous tissues 
measuring 3.1 cm x 3.2 cm.  There is no significant surrounding 
fat stranding.  This likely represents a postoperative seroma.
2. There is a long segment of distal ileum, with circumferential 
wall
thickening, suggestive of enteritis.

Brief Hospital Course:
PATIENT SUMMARY
=====================
___ woman with h/o ESRD from polycystic kidney disease
s/p renal transplant (___) on sirolimus/tacrolimus, with recent
hernia repair, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and
non-bloody non-bilious vomiting, concerning for a viral 
gastroenteritis. The patient recovered with IV rehydration and 
symptomatic management.

ACTIVE ISSUES
=====================
#Abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, a watery diarrhea
The patient most likely had infectious colitis, given her 
sudden-onset
watery diarrhea after eating heated frozen-food products. Given 
the patient's immunosuppressed status, parasitic/opportunistic 
infections were also considered, and a thorough work-up was 
performed. She had undetectable CMV viral load, and a negative 
C. diff
PCR. Bacterial colitis was considered very unlikely, as she did 
not have bloody diarrhea or fevers, and never had an elevated 
white count, so antibiotics were not started. Ischemic colitis 
was also considered unlikely. CT scan showed enteritis, and also 
demonstrated a post-operative seroma near her hernia repair 
site, with no concerning signs of infection or abscess. The 
patient clinically improved with symptomatic management - 
aggressive IV rehydration, Zofran PRN for nausea, and advancing 
diet as tolerated.

___
Creatinine on admission was 2.3, with baseline 1.3-1.6. 
Responded very well to IVF, and was 1.7 at time of discharge. 
___ was likely prerenal i/s/o large GI losses. Rejection or ATN 
were considered very unlikely, especially as her Cr improved 
with fluids. Lisinopril and HCTZ were held i/s/o ___ 
continue to hold on discharge; can be restarted pending 
resolution of her ___.

#Acute Anemia
Hemoglobin down-trended from 10.2 to 8.7 today, which was most 
likely
dilutional from her IVF administration, as no source of bleeding 
was ever identified, and no concerning findings were seen on CT.

#Ascites
Seen on CT abdomen/pelvis, most likely from IVF administration. 
LFTs normal; low concern for cirrhosis despite known polycystic 
liver.

#Immunosuppression
#Renal Transplant
Sirolimus was discontinued to promote wound healing from 
laproscopic surgical site from umbilical hernia repair. Patient 
was continued on tacrolimus 1.5 mg Q12H, and trough was 5.8. 
Goal trough is ___ in absence of sirolimus, but dose was not 
increased on this admission, as per the nephrology team there is 
still sufficient sirolimus residual level in her system. Her 
dose may need to be up-titrated as an outpatient to reach 
therapeutic levels, if trough continues to be less than 6.

CHRONIC ISSUES
======================
#Hypertension
- Held home lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide in setting of ___ 
continue to hold on discharge. Restart upon resolution ___ 
per above.

#Hyperlipidemia
- continued pravastatin 20 mg daily

#Hypothyroidism: s/p radioiodine ablation
- continued home levothyroxine 88 mcg daily

#Anxiety/Insomnia
- continued home clonazepam 0.5 mg QHS PRN insomnia

#GERD
- continued home pantoprazole 40 mg Q24H

===================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
#Renal Transplant
[]Discontinued sirolimus, to promote wound healing from her 
recent hernia surgery, restart when medically appropriate
[]F/u tacrolimus labs within 3 weeks, Dr. ___ will review and 
adjust levels to goal trough going forward. Will likely need 
up-titration, as goal trough is ___, but level was 5.8 on 
discharge. Did not increase during patient's hospitalization, as 
her sirolimus had just been discontinued.
#HTN
[]Held lisinopril and HCTZ due to ___, please resume as 
outpatient when Cr returns to baseline.
___
[]Please f/u repeat labs within 1 week, to confirm resolution of 
her ___
#Diarrhea
[]Stool ova and parasites still pending at time of discharge, we 
will f/u and contact PCP if anything returns positive
#Anemia: Hgb downtrending 11.5 -> 8.2 during admission, most 
likely dilutional as normal vital signs and no source of 
bleeding on CT with totally benign abdominal exam, as well as 
normal hemolysis labs.
[]Follow-up CBC as outpatient.

# HEALTH CARE PROXY: sister, ___ ___

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ underwent uncomplicated laparoscopic umbilical hernia

extubated post-procedure. However, approximately twenty minutes 
after arrival to the PACU she developed audible inspiratory 
stridor and difficulty breathing. Her symptoms did not improve 
with racemic epinephrine or nebulizer treatment. The decision 
was made to reintubate her for acute hypoxic respiratory 
failure. During fiberoptic intubation, there was noted hypo 
mobility of the vocal cords. Re-intubaiton was successful. There 
was no evidence of allergic reaction nor additional pathology 
noted.

ENT was consulted, who recommend re-extubation with airway teams 
available. The patient was successfully extubated the same 
evening. She had a normal fiberoptic exam at time of extubation.

Fiberoptic Exam:
In the context of the patient's clinical presentation and the
need to visualize the regions in close proximity, the decision
was made to proceed with an endoscopic exam.  Accordingly, after
verbal consent and topical lidocaine with oxymetazoline
anesthesia, the fiberoptic scope was passed to visualize the
regions of concern.  The findings were:
Normal nasal cavity, no pus or polyps
Normal nasopharynx, no masses
Normal oropharynx
Epiglottis crisp
Supraglottic area normal
Arytenoid complexes mobile bilaterally/symetrically
True vocal folds symmetric and mobile bilaterally, no masses, no
erythema
Pyriform sinuses clear
No significant pooling of secretions

The patient was weaned from supplemental oxygen. On POD#1 she 
was feeling well, out of bed and ambulating with appropriate 
saturations on room air. She was discharged home on POD#1.
