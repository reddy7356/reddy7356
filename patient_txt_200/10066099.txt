initiated. He was transferred to ___ the early evening of 
___
and admitted to the medical floor. Psychiatry is consulted for
risk assessment in the setting of a suicide attempt.
     Patient reports that he has been feeling "depressed" and 
has
been sleeping and eating poorly for the past few weeks. He 
states
he sleeps "at the most 6 hours" each night. He is an 
___
student at ___ and states that
academic pressure has been mounting this semester. He remains in
good academic standing, but says that he is "always behind" and
describes his major's evaluation system as strict and very
unpredictable. He said that prior to the ingestion, he had
thoughts about "how it would be easier if it could all just be
over" and took 100 500mg pills of acetaminophen with the intent
of ending his life. He reports that shortly after the ingestion,
he sent a message to one of his close friends to tell her what 
he
did "because I didn't want to just leave everyone without saying
anything". This friend notified the patient's mother and aunt,
who then called ___.
     In addition to his academic stress, patient describes a
recent legal problem he has encountered which became acutely
distressing for him the day prior to this suicide attempt.
Approximately three weeks ago, he states he found a debit card 
on
the ground. He made some purchases with the card. On ___, he
states that police came to his place of work and asked to speak
with him about it. At that point, he explained what he had done
and turned the card into the police. He reports that an officer
"read me my rights" and had him sign a piece of paper at the
time. He now is unsure what consequences/charges he may face
because of this incident.
     After the ingestion, patient reports he vomited repeatedly
(involuntarily) and experienced abdominal pain. "It's more work
to leave than it is to stay". He states that he now feels 
"happy"
that he did not die, and says "I have a lot to live for; I have 
a
lot to look forward to."

increased risk of harm to himself and/or others based upon 
recent suicide attempt with stated intent to end his life.  His 
static factors noted at that time included recent suicide 
attempt, male gender, age and single status. The modifiable risk 
factors at that time included depressed mood with hopelessness, 
no established outpatient psychiatric providers, poor sleep, and 
suicidal ideation. These factors were addressed by individual, 
group, and milieu therapy, initiation of antidepressant 
medication, and connection with outpatient therapist and 
psychiatrist.  Finally, the patient is being discharged with 
many protective risk factors, including help-seeking nature, 
future-oriented viewpoint, support from mother, life 
satisfaction, medication compliance, no history of substance 
use. Overall, the patient is not at an acutely elevated risk of 
self-harm nor danger to others due to acutely decompensated 
psychiatric illness.

======================
___ is a ___ man with no past medical history who presented 
after a suicide attempt by ingesting Tylenol ___ (50g 
Acetaminophen + 2.5g Diphenhydramine). NAC was initiated 16 
hours later and his acetaminophen level was normal at 20 hours. 
He as placed on a section 12a hold and was treated with NAC for 
several days until his LFTs downtrended. He was then discharged 
to an inpatient psychiatric facility. 

ACTIVE ISSUES
=============
# ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSE
# DIPHENHYDRAMINE OVERDOSE
Known ingestion time 9PM on ___, NAC started 16h later 1PM on 
___. He was persistently asymptomatic with no abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, and with no signs of anticholinergic toxicity. 
His acetaminophen level was negative approximately 20 hours 
after time of ingestion and his INR was persistently normal. NAC 
was continued until his LFTs downtrended. 

# SUICIDE ATTEMPT
Likely in setting of significant social stressors, legal 
concern, and poor social support (no friends he talks to 
routinely). First episode with no prior attempts. He did meet 
some SIGECAPS criteria for major depression (sleep changes, 
decreased appetite, suicidal ideation, difficulty concentrating) 
but given the acute time course it was difficult to rule out 
adjustment disorder. Psychiatry was consulted and placed a 
section 12a hold on admission. He persistently denied SI/HI 
throughout his hospitalization, appeared of normal affect, and 
reported a good mood. On discharge he was transferred to an 
inpatient psychiatric facility.
