Brief Hospital Course:
This a ___ with a history of L MCA CVA (with R hemiplegia), DM2, 
who presented from his PCP office for likely subacute GI bleed
.
# Upper GI bleed:-presumed due to duodenitis and erythema seen 
on EGD. The patient presented  with a 9 point Hct drop (from 
___ with melena on exam concerning for a  upper GI bleed. 
___ score of 9. He was s/p 1 unit pRBC in the ED with 
stable H/H during admission while on the medical floor. GI was 
consulted and performed and EGD ___ which revealed duodenitis. 
GI recommended BID PPI x 8 weeks and to send stool antigen for 
H.pylori and treat if positive. However, stool was unable to be 
sent during admission as pt did not have enough stool specimen. 
Pt's diet was advanced ___ successfully and he did not have any 
further episodes of GI bleeding after EGD. Colonoscopy/flex sig 
was attempted as well on ___. However, pt was unable to 
tolerate or continue with the prep and study was non-diagnostic 
and unable to be performed. Discussed with pt's daugther that 
even if pt were to have a colonic lesion found he is unlikely to 
desire a surgical intervention and dtg agreed. HCT stable on DC. 
See above. Plan is to f/u with PCP for repeat HCT check, outpt 
GI and to have consideration of outpt colonoscopy with prolonged 
prep and to send stool antigen for H.pylori and treat if 
positive.

.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient presented with elevated 
BUN:Cr (baseline BUN wnl, Cr 1.13). Likely component from bleed 
and hypovolemia also from history of recent vomiting while still 
taking diuretics. S/p 1 uPRBC. Creatinine improved. Pt was 
restarted on his home BP medications on the day of DC. Can 
recheck Cr at f/u appointment.
.
# Hypertension: In the setting of GI bleed (and ___ held 
lisinopril and HCTZ. These were resumed upon discharge after 
ensuring hemodynamic stability. 
.
# DM2, controlled but with neuropathy: Given ___, held 
metformin. Pt was given HISS, metformin resumed upon DC. 
.
# HLD: On simvastatin at home.
.
# CVA with residual right hemiplegia: full dose ASA on hold 
given GIB.  Resumed aspirin at 81 mg upon DC given the above.
.

Discharge Instructions:
You were sent from your PCP's office to the hospital for concern 
of gastrointestinal bleeding, given your drop in your red blood 
cell counts (acute anemia).  You received 1 unit transfusion of 
blood.  Your blood counts were stable after transfusion.  You 
underwent endoscopy which showed inflammation in your small 
intestine "duodenitis".  We also recommended that you decrease 
your daily aspirin to 81mg from 325mg to decrease the risk of 
bleeding. You were started on a medication called pantoprazole 
(protonix) to take twice a day for 8 weeks for your bleeding. We 
attempted a colonoscopy/flexible sigmoidoscopy but this was 
unsuccessful due to poor prep. You may continue to discuss the 
need for this test with your outpatient providers.
