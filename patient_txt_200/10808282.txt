CXR
IMPRESSION: Ill-defined opacity within the right lower lobe 
concerning for an 
infectious process. Small bilateral pleural effusions. 
Cardiomegaly without 
overt evidence for congestive heart failure. 

EKG
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. The Q-T interval is 
prolonged. Non-specific 
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
there is no 
significant change. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with ESRD on HD, cirrhosis, d/CHF, 
and C.diff who presented with N/V/D x ___ days.  
.    
## N/V/Diarrhea: the ddx is recurrent C-diff, IBD, ischemic 
colitis, however all of these are less likely given benign 
abdominal exam, lack of blood, and lack of cramping and pain on 
exam. Regardless, stool Cxs were sent (C-diff negative, rest of 
panel pending). Given poor PO intake, rehydrated with 2 L of 
fluid given slowly.  Of note, he has multiple admissions for the 
same issue, and we were hesitant to attribute this again to 
gastroenteritis.  Rather, we sent for a random fecal fat which 
was pending at time of discharge.  We held off on sending a TTG 
given that this has been negative multiple times in the past.  
The pt was also scheduled for GI f/u to continue working on this 
issue.  We did continue the pt on his PO vanc for C-diff ppx, 
but agree with recent note from PCP that unclear that this is 
entirely required given that in our system, has only had Cdiff + 
x 1 and he continues ___ have diarrhea despite vancomycin 
treatment.  Pt notably had prolonged QTc, so did not give zofran 
for nausea, but rather gave compazine.  The pt's VS, WBC, and 
temp were trended and remained wnl throughout his hospital 
course.  The patient was kept on clears on th first day and 
advanced to a full renal diet (with low residue, low lactose) on 
HD2.  He felt much better after one day and he was discharged 
after being able to advance his diet to regulars (renal, low 
residue, lactose controlled).  His diarrhea and vomiting also 
resolved by that point in time. Of note, he had several organ 
involvements without clear diagnosis (renal, liver, cardiac, and 
GI). A unifying diagnosis in this relatively young man is 
needed. 
.  
## ESRD on HD: Pt is on ___ schedule, and given that he 
missed dialysis x 1, he was dialyzed on ___ instead.  We 
renally dosed his medications, and avoided nephrotoxins.
.  
## ?PNA/opacity on CXR: Seen on prior films, clinically looks 
well without respiratory si/sxs of PNA.  We followed Mr. ___ 
clinically, trended his WBC, temperature curve, and did not feel 
the need to treat with abx given his clinical picture and 
unchanged CXR.  
.
Of note, the opacity seems to possibly have a cavitary section, 
and we would consider CT Chest with contrast as an outpatient to 
fully evaluate this lesion.
.  
## Anemia/Hct drop: Pt noted to have Hct of 39 at time of 
admission, on HD2, noted to be 33. Per review of records, 33 
seems more likely his baseline and 39 may have been spuriously 
high. Iron studies c/w ACD.  Recheck of Hct was stable at 34.9.  
We continued to trend his Hct and kept an active t/S.  Guaiac 
was performed which was negative. 
.  
## report of prolonged QTc: EKG in ED showed prolonged QTc 
(473).  We avoided medications that could potentially increase 
this (FQ, zofran).  We continued to monitor the pt. 
.
## HTN: Continued home medications - lisinopril, Toprol XL  
.  
## CAD: Continued lisinopril and ASA and Toprol XL  
.  
## Smoking hx: nicotine patch while in house  
.
## Depression: Continue fluoxetine  
.
## FOLLOW UP ISSUES
1) Consider CT Chest with contrast to evaluate opacity on CXR 
that has been present in last few films.  Already discussed with 
PCP.
2) Consider d/c of PO vancomycin at later point given lack of 
evidence of multiple C-diff infections.
3) Consider decrease in narcotic dosages given somnolence noted 
in dialysis.
4) Will be seeing GI. Question of possible bxs to w/u this N/V  
issue.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with CKD Stage V on HD, prior epidural abscess, 
and recently accidently removed G tube admitted from rehab 
facility with concern for lethargy, low-grade temperatures, and 
bandemia. Brief hospital course was as follows:

1. Bandemia/?lethargy:  Throughout hospital course patient 
emphasized feeling very well. He was tired day prior to 
admission after a prolonged shopping trip, but has otherwise had 
no weakness above baseline. Left shift on admission was 
concerning for evolving infection; WBC count since coming down 
with resolved bandemia. Suspected sources for possible infection 
included infection at former PEG tube site, bacteremia, or 
pneumonia given increased oxygen requirement at presentation. No 
evidence of abscess or skin infection at former PEG tube site. 
No growth from blood cultures to date (drawn before antibiotics 
initiated). No infiltrates that would be consistent with 
pneumonia seen on chest radiograph. No increase in diarrhea 
(patient with history of C. difficile). Patient received one 
dose of levofloxacin in emergency department. Patient was 
continued on empiric vancomycin per HD protocol - on day of 
discharge random vancomycin level 20. Patient not to be 
continued on antibiotics as outpatient. If he has fevers, 
becomes more lethargic, or has increased erythema concerning for 
cellulitis at lower extremities, patient may need to be started 
on vancomycin IV once again. On discharge, feeling well, with 
normal WBC count, afebrile, and not requiring oxygen 
supplementation.

2. History of C difficile infection: We spoke to facility on 
admission; patient on vancomycin long-term given reoccurrence 
when off of vancomycin in the past. Patient was continued on 
vancomycin PO daily. No evidence of diarrhea/active infection at 
this admission.

3. ESRD, Stage 5: Patient is anuric. Continued on home regimen 
of ___ dialysis. Continued on appropriate renal 
medications.

4. Elevated troponin: Elevated on admission but in range similar 
to that in previous admissions. Likely related to renal failure. 
Patient without symptoms concerning for ACS, and no concerning 
changes seen on EKG on admission. No concerning arrythmias were 
noted on telemetry.

5. Hypoxia, now resolved: On presentation required oxygen (99% 
on 4 L/min) and was noted to have bilateral pleural effusions. 
Hypoxia was likely secondary to fluid overload on admission, and 
improved following dialysis. On discharge, patient is satting 
well on room air.

6. Chronic systolic heart failure: Noted to be fluid overloaded 
on exam on admission. Patient was continued on home regimen 
including beta-blocker; ACE inhibitor was temoporarily held 
given hyperkalemia, but restarted on discharge. Patient should 
have electrolytes rechecked in ___ days.

7. Cachexia: Chronic by review of patient records. Patient 
reported he would be willing to have G tube replaced but only as 
an outpatient. Appointment scheduled for ___ at 
7:00am. Patient is to be off of aspirin for one week prior to 
procedure, and should be NPO after midnight morning of 
procedure.

extremities on admission, concerning for PVD. Patient should 
have ABI studies done to assess for PVD if not done within past 
6 months.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o man with ESRD on HD who presented initially 
on ___ with increasing low back pain since MVC in ___. He has had a complicated complicated hospital course since 
then, which I will summarize briefly here. He initially had an 
outpatient MRI which showed question of paraspinal abscess. He 
had been told to come to the ED right away, but did not do so 
until several days later. The back pain at that time was 
centered in his low back with radiation down the anterior 
bilateral thighs (R>L). He denied fevers. Spine CT showed 
findings concerning for a destructive infectious process. OSH 
MRI showed L3 burst fx and retropulsion onto cauda, as well as 
paraspinal abscess. He was admitted to medicine for further 
evaluation, with ortho spine service consulting. He was 
initially started on vanc/gent, and then changed to 
nafcillin/gent. Blood cultures grew MSSA.  
.  
Of note, he was seen in the ED in ___ with anemia, at which 
time he spiked a temp to 101 and blood cultures were obtained. 
The patient left AMA from that ED visit, and cultures ultimately 
grew MSSA. He was treated for MSSA with cefazolin at HD from 
___ to ___, but it is unclear if this course was optimal given 
patient's history of missing HD sessions.  
.  
The patient was treated with antibiotics on the medical service 
until ___, when the patient was taken to the OR for L2-L4 
anterior fusion, following which he remained intubated and on 
pressors in the SICU. On ___ he had a posterior fusion. He 
initially did well and was weaned off pressors. He was extubated 
on ___, but on ___ his respiratory status worsened and he 
became more hypoxic. He had a thoracentesis followed by a L 
chest tube placement for pneumothorax. He was reintubated that 
day. A CT scan of his torso on ___ also showed a large left 
sided abdominal fluid collection. On ___ a drain was placed by 
___, producing 800 cc bloody fluid not noted to be purulent (no 
growth to date on culture). Around that time the patient 
developed a new pressor requirement.  
.  
On ___ he was extubated. On ___ he was taken back to the OR for 
a posterior wound dehiscence. I&D was performed, and a VAC 
device was applied. He has now been off pressors since the 
morning of ___. He was extubated again on ___ and passed a 
speech and swallow evaluation on ___. His chest tube was taken 
out today, as was the intra-abdominal drain.  
.  
Currently, he states that his pain is well controlled with 
medications, but he does feel anxious. He denies other 
complaints.

VITAMIN B1, BLOOD             115                 87-280 NMOL/L

CT Spine ___:
CT lumbar spine without contrast.

FINDINGS: There is extensive destructive process, centered at 
L2-3 disc space, which is obliterated, with extensive 
irregularity of end-plates and significant loss of height of 
vertebral body of L3 and marked irregularity of L2 inferior 
endplate and retropulsion of the bony fragments. The canal 
measures only 9 mm (AP) at this level. Additionally, there is 
high- attenuation material in the epidural space, adjacent to 
the largest retropulsed fragment, which may represent hemorrhage 
but is also concerning for infection. There is associated 
kyphotic angulation at L2-3 level.

Calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted. Paraspinal soft 
tissues are not well evaluated in this non-contrast 
non-dedicated study.

IMPRESSION: Extensive destructive process at L2-3 level, with 
significant retropulsion of bony fragments, narrowing the spinal 
canal and compressing the thecal sac at this level. This 
constellation of findings, including significant osseous 
destruction, disc and endplate involvement and adjacent density 
in the epidural space, are concerning for infection, perhaps 
complicated by recent trauma. However, occasionally, the chronic 
spondyloarthropathy associated with ESRD can mimic the 
diskitis/vertebral osteomyelitis complex. For this reason, 
review of the prompting OSH MR, and comparison to any prior 
studies would be most helpful.

TTE ___:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is 
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = ___, 
without regional wall motion abnormalities (c/w a diffuse 
process, such as toxic, metabolic, sepsis, etc). Right 
ventricular cavity size and systolic function are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good 
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve 
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. 
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen 
on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

CT Chest ___:
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is overall evidence of volume 
overload with a moderate right pleural effusion and 
small-to-moderate left pleural effusion with associated passive 
atelectasis. There is body wall edema consistent with anasarca 
and the partially visualized upper abdomen demonstrates ascites. 
Septal thickening in this case in a predominantly bibasilar 
distribution, is consistent with hydrostatic edema. It is 
indeterminent whether thickening of the peribroncovascular 
bundles is secondary to hydrostatic edema or attributable to 
infection.

A nodular opacity with irregular margins is present at the 
periphery of the right upper lobe (3:7) in segment 1 measuring 
1.7 x 1.3 cm. A second nodular opacity in a peribronchovascular 
distribution is present in the right upper lobe measuring 9 x 8 
mm. Focal regions of peribronchiolar nodules are present within 
the lungs for example in the left upper lobe (3:10) suggesting 
bronchiolar infection. Focal bulla is stable in the left lower 
lobe. A left PICC line and left double-lumen dialysis catheter 
present with tips residing within the distal SVC.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are 
identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse volume overload with moderate effusions, anasarca and 
ascites.

2. Mild widespread bronchiolar infectious process. Given that 
several opacities have a nodular configuration, followup CT 
chest without contrast is recommended in three months to ensure 
resolution. In a patient with paraspinal abscess, septic emboli 
should also be considered as a cause for nodules although the 
appearance and distribution of these opacities are not typical 
of this condition.

MIBI:
Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-99m sestamibi. 
Tracer was
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting 
images. 

Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous 
dipyridamole,
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m sestamibi 
was administered
intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 45 
minutes following
tracer injection. 

Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT. 
This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial 
perfusion model. 

INTERPRETATION: 
The image quality is adequate. 
Left ventricular cavity size is marked dilated at stress and 
rest. 

Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake 
throughout the 
left ventricular myocardium. No reversible defects. 

Gated images reveal global hypokinesia. 
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 16%. 

IMPRESSION: 1) Severe dilated cardiomyopathy; LVEF 16%. New from 
study of
___. 2) No reversible perfusion defects. 

L4 Disc biopsy:
Intervertebral disc L3-4:

 

Acute osteomyelitis with osteonecrosis. See note.

 

Note:  

Sections of bone show fibrosis of the marrow space with chronic 
inflammatory cells.  This finding may represent changes due to 
trauma or chronic osteomyelitis. In addition, there are small 
aggregates of neutrophils, some admixed with fibrinous exudate, 
adjacent to bone and within bony lacunae.  This finding is 
consistent with an on-going acute osteomyelitis. Slides B and C 
reviewed with Dr. ___.

 

Dr. ___ notified of diagnosis ___ at 3:30 ___.

RUQ U/S:
1. Large right pleural effusion and moderate ascites, new since 
___.

2. Normal-appearing gallbladder without evidence of acute 
cholecystitis.

3. Bright linear echogenic regions in the expected region of the 
ductal confluence of uncertain etiology. Diagnostic 
possibilities include air and stones within the central biliary 
tree, more likely than interposed loops of bowel within the 
porta hepatis. These findings may be expected if patient has had 
endoscopic sphincterotomy or similar procedure; however, reports 
in CareWeb do not reflect this. Further evaluation may be 
obtained with CT or MRI as indicated.

CT-GUIDED DRAINAGE PROCEDURE 
The patient's sister and medical proxy, ___, was contacted. 
Discussion of risks and benefits including specific risks of 
bleeding, infection, injury to abdominal organs and bowel, and 
need for additional surgery, was discussed. Informed consent was 
obtained over the telephone and witnessed. The patient was 
placed on the CT examination table in the supine position. The 
left lower abdomen was marked. The skin was prepped and draped 
in the usual sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered 
with 1% lidocaine. A 10 ___ all-purpose drainage catheter was 
then introduced into a large heterogeneous fluid collection 
containing both high-density foci and air consistent with clot 
and abscess. Approximately 800 cc of hemorrhagic fluid was 
aspirated. The fluid was sent for microbiology. The drain was 
secured in place. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient 
tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the intensive 
care unit for additional monitoring.

Dr. ___ was present and available throughout the entire 
procedure. Sedation was administered by the ICU nurse.

IMPRESSION: Technically successful placement of a 10 ___ 
all-purpose drainage catheter into a large intra-abdominal 
abscess. 800 cc of hemorrhagic fluid aspirated.

CXR ___:
There has been interval removal of left-sided central venous 
catheter. Left-sided chest tube and right-sided central venous 
catheter are in unchanged position. Previously seen left apical 
pneumothorax not identified on current study. Cardiac and 
mediastinal contours appear unchanged. Bilateral pleural 
effusions are again seen, not significantly changed allowing for 
positional differences. Spinal fusion hardware again noted.

IMPRESSION: Interval removal of left-sided central venous line. 
No definite pneumothorax identified.

PICC Placement:
Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left brachial 
vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a 
micropuncture set. Hard copies of the ultrasound images were 
obtained before and immediately after establishing intravenous 
access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guidewire 
and a single lumen PIC line measuring 37 cm in length was placed 
through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC 
under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was 
confirmed by fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away 
sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was then 
secured to the skin, flushed, and sterile dressing applied. The 
patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate 
complications.

IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and fluoroscopically guided 
single lumen PICC line placement via the left brachial vein 
approach. Final internal length is 37 cm with the tip positioned 
in the SVC. The line is ready to use.

AVF evaluation and dilation:
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After explaining the risks and benefits 
of the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient. The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table 
and the right upper arm was prepped and draped in standard 
sterile fashion. A preprocedure timeout was performed.

After injection of local anesthesia, access was gained into the 
proximal cephalic vein of the right upper extremity AV 
fistulogram with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle. A 0.018 
guidewire was advanced through the needle into the upper 
cephalic vein and a needle was exchanged for a 4.5 ___ 
micropuncture sheath. Venogram was performed with injection of 
contrast through the micropuncture sheath to evaluate from the 
cephalic vein to the central vein, ___ demonstrated no area of 
stenosis. Inflation of blood pressure cuff at the right upper 
arm, another venogram was performed with injection of the 
contrast through the sheath to evaluate the arterior anastomosis 
site of AV fistula. Venogram demonstrated about 2 cm tight 
stenosis at proximal cephalic vein with multiple collateral 
veins and venous dilatation of cephalic vein proximal to the 
stenotic portion. Based on the diagnostic findings, it was 
decided that the patient would benefit from and was a good 
candidate for angioplasty. The micropuncture sheath had to be 
removed because stenotic portion is too near the puncture site. 
Thus we decided to get another access into the upper cephalic 
vein. Using ultrasound guidance and palpatory technique, after 
several attempts, retrograde access was gained into the upper 
cephalic vein with a 21- gauge micropuncture needle. A 0.018 
guidewire was advanced through the needle into the proximal 
cephalic portion under fluoroscopic guidance and the needle was 
exchanged for a 4.5 ___ micropuncture sheath. The 
micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 6 ___ ___ tip 
sheath. Another venogram was performed with a 5 ___ straight 
multisided-holed catheter, which demonstrated about 2 cm 
stenotic portion at the proximal cephalic vein. Stenotic portion 
of the proximal cephalic vein was dilated with 6 mm x 4 cm and 8 
mm x 4 cm balloons. A followup venogram demonstrated widely 
patent stenotic portion at proximal cephalic vein and multiple 
collateral veins disappeared. After balloon dilatation, venous 
bulging proximal to the stenotic portion also decreased.

Vascular sheath was removed and manual compression was held for 
15 minutes until hemostasis was achieved. A v-pad was applied at 
the puncture site of upper cephalic vein to prevent the bleeding 
at the puncture site. The patient tolerated the procedure well 
and there were no immediate complications.

Sedation was provided by administering divided doses of fentanyl 
and Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 105 minutes 
during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were 
continuously monitored.

IMPRESSION: Fistulogram demonstrated about 2 cm tight stenosis 
at the proximal cephalic vein of right UE AV fistula with 
multiple collateral veins. Balloon dilatation was performed with 
6 and 8 mm x 4 cm balloons and with good angiographic results.

HD line placement:
PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: Details of the procedure and possible 
complications were explained and informed consent was obtained.
A preprocedure timeout was performed. The patient was placed 
supine on the angiographic table and the indwelling catheter and 
left upper chest were prepped and draped in standard sterile 
fashion. An initial fluoroscopic image demonstrated a temporary 
catheter with tip in the ___/right atrium junction.

10 cc of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine were used to anesthetize 
the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Following a small skin 
incision, the subcutaneous tunnel was created by blunt 
dissection and the line was tunneled through the subcutaneous 
tissue. After aspirating each lumen, a 0.035 guidewire was 
advanced through the catheter to the inferior vena cava under 
fluoroscopic guidance. Catheter was then exchanged for a 
peel-away sheath. The wire and the inner dilator of the 
peel-away were then removed and the line was advanced through 
the peel-away sheath and positioned with its tip at the level of 
the SVC/right atrium junction. The peel-away sheath was removed.

The line was flushed, heplocked and secured to the skin with 0 
silk sutures. The venous access site incision was closed with 
Dermabond and ___ Vicryl sutures. A sterile dressing was 
applied. Final fluoroscopic image demonstrated tip of the 
catheter to be located in the ___/right atrium junction.

Moderate sedation was provided by administering Fentanyl and 
Versed in divided doses

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no 
immediate complications.

IMPRESSION: Successful conversion of temporary line to a 
tunneled 27-cm tip to cuff double lumen line for dialysis via 
the left subclavian vein with tip in the SVC/right atrium. The 
line is ready for use.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Please see HPI for a summary of events prior to his transfer 
from the SICU to the floor. After transfer to the floor the 
events are as follows:

.
.
# Low back pain, paraspinal abscess, s/p s/p L2-L4 anterior ___ 
followed by posterior fusion ___: Now s/p anterior and 
posterior fusion by ortho spine surgery. Most recently had wound 
dehiscence and I+D done on ___. The patient was started on and 
should continue on IV nafcillin and rifampin for at least 8 
weeks after the dates of his surgery for treatment of his MSSA 
bacteremia and paraspinal abscess. A PICC line is in place for 
continued IV antibiotics. Furthermore, enterobacter was cultured 
from tissue taken from the wound dehiscence on ___ which was 
treated with ciprofloxacin and should be continued until his 
follow up appointment with the ID fellow, ___. Originally he 
had a vacuum dressing in place on his anterior fixation wound 
but that was removed on ___. An occlusive dressing should be 
maintained with daily changes. He should be in his TLSO brace 
when he is out of bed. His pain was controlled with methadone 
and percocet with good effect. He will follow up with the 
orthopedic surgeons as well. 
.
# Hypoglycemia: The patient developed episodes of hypoglycemia 
towards the endo of his SICU course, treated with a D10 drip. 
These episodes continued on transfer to the floor, worst first 
thing in the morning. Endocrine was consulted and felt that 
these episodes were likely due to poor oral intake of protein 
and complex carbohydrates C-peptide, betahydroxybutyrate and 
insulin levels sent at the time of a hypoglycemic event were 
normal, making a hyperinsulinemic cause much less likely. He was 
encouraged to increase his intake which improved his blood 
sugars. It should be ensured that the patient receives a high 
protein snack such as peanut butter and crackers just before bed 
to lessen am hypoglycemia. The patient should be encouraged to 
eat calorie dense, high protein food. 
.
# Diarrhea: The patient began having diarrhea towards the end of 
his SICU course, requiring a rectal tube. C.difficile was 
checked x3 as well as a cytotoxin B, which were all negative. 
Diarrhea was felt to be a combination of antibiotic effect, low 
albumin (1.6) and a mild intolerance to lactose. He was started 
on loperamide, lomotil and a lactose free diet with improvement 
of his diarrhea.
.
# Right arm swelling: The patient developed swelling of his 
right arm superior to his fistula. A fistulogram confirmed a 
stenosis which was dilated by intervential radiology. However, 
the nephrology team did not feel his fistula was ready for use 
immediately after and it may take a week or two to recover. A 
tunnelled left IJ HD line was place to be used in the interim.
.
# Anemia: Post-op, likely related to blood loss, plus component 
of anemia from ESRD. Epogen at HD. Monitor hct.
.
# Pleural effusions: He had bilateral effusions- could be due to 
CHF, given EF 15%. L effusion was tapped, but unfortunately TP 
and LDH were not sent so not certain if transudate vs. exudate. 
Fluid culture and cytology were negative. Respiratory status 
remained stable and he was on room air at the time of discharge. 
Unless his respiratory status worsens, these should be followed 
by his PCP. 
.
# Cardiomyopathy/Depressed EF: The patient developed an 
apparently new cardiomyopathy with an EF of ___ on this 
admission, down from 45-50% in ___. Pre-op stress MIBI showed 
no reversible perfusion defects making ischemia less likely. He 
was started on metoprolol and low dose lisinopril. His fluid 
status was managed via hemodialysis. 
.
# ESRD on HD: On ___ need continued renal follow up. 
Continued nephrocaps, phoslo and epogen with HD.
.
# FEN: Very poor nutritional status (INR has been elevated, 
albumin 1.6 on admission to the floor). Regular lactose free 
diet, with pudding and shake supplements. He should be encourage 
to eat as much as possible. If further improvements in 
nutritional intake are not met, TPN, NG, or PEG tube feedings 
may be considered.

active bleeding once he arrived at ___. Has chronic anemia ___ 
ESRD. Transfused 2 units early on during his hospitalization. 
Hct on admission was 23.7 and remained stable at 28 after being 
transfused. Had intermittently guaiac positive stools but no 
further hematemesis or melena. He was maintained on a PPI BID. 
GI evaluated the patient and deferred colonoscopy or EGD as an 
inpatient given the bleeding had stabilized. He will follow-up 
with GI as an outpatient.     
.  
# Poor nutritional status: Pt is severely cachectic with diffuse 
muscle wasting. Was getting TFs at rehab via NGT. Alb 1.9-->2.9 
from his previous admission to this admission. Nutrition was 
consulted and calorie counts revealed he was not meeting his

# Hypoglycemia: Likely ___ low glycogen stores with decreased PO 
intake. Followed with q4 finger sticks and encouraged PO intake. 
Also made sure the patient took in complex carbs ___ 
crackers and peanut butter) every night to prevent nocturnal 
hypoglycemia. Fingersticks improved when tube feeds were 
initiated.
.
# ___ numbness/pain: Pt complained of numbness and tingling in 
his bilateral lower extremities. Likely peripheral neuropathy. 
DDx would also include hypothyroidism (TSH was 8) or due to his 
chronic illness. B12 was wnl. He was started on gabapentin 300mg 
qHS. This can be up-titrated as needed as an outpatient.
.
# MSSA paraspinal abscess, bacteremia, and L3-4 osteomyelitis 
now s/p L2-4 anterior/posterior spinal L2-4 fusion: MSSA at 
L2-4. Do not appear to be any new issues. Continue nafcillin for 
8 wk course per ID, followed by Dr. ___. Rifampin d/c'd on ___ 
due to increasing LFTs. Incision draining serosanguinous fluid 
but no evidence of infection. Continued TLSO brace when he is

# Cardiomyopathy/Depressed EF: No active issues. Relatively new 
cardiomyopathy with an EF of ___ recently discovered, of 
unclear etiology. On last admission, pre-op stress MIBI showed 
no reversible perfusion defects making ischemia less likely and 
he was started on metoprolol and low dose lisinopril. Metoprolol 
and lisinopril were held initially in the setting of GI bleed 
and relatively low blood pressure. BB and ACEI were added back 
slowly as his BP tolerated. Lisinopril can be increased to his 
previous dose of 5mg daily as his BP allows. Fluid status was 
managed via HD.  
.  
# ESRD on HD: On MWF schedule, followed by Dr. ___. 
Continued nephrocaps, phoslo and epogen with HD. Continued on 
regular HD schedule. During this admission he was successfully

IMAGING:
CXR:  FINDINGS: Bilateral pleural effusions persist and are 
likely increased slightly. Heart size is again noted to be 
enlarged. Pulmonary vascular engorgement persists and is 
similar. Lung volumes are low. Linear opacities at the right 
base appear similar compared to prior and likely represent 
atelectasis or scarring. Lumbar spine hardware is incompletely 
imaged.  Right-sided dialysis catheter is poorly evaluated on 
this study, but likely terminates in the low right atrium. Right 
subclavian stent is again noted. 
  
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly, pulmonary vascular prominence, 
and bilateral pleural effusions, probably increased somewhat. 

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood Cultures:  Pending
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  ___ yo male with end stage renal, liver, 
heart and lung disease along with overlaying depression who was 
admitted with weakness after missing a dialysis appointment two 
days prior to admission.  Patient recieved dialysis with 
improvement in his symptoms.  Patient was screened by ___ and 
determined to need short term rehab.

#WEAKNESS:  PER PCP this is indeed the complaints a man with 
multiorgan failure and progressive decline over several months.  
Patient had some improvement in his symptoms with dialysis 
though there was a singificant contribution of his symptoms by 
decondidtioning.  Patient was seen by physical therapy who 
recommended that he receive short term rehabilitation to improve 
his endurance and balance.  There were no major metabolic, 
infectious or hemodynamic causes of his weakness uncovered and 
the patient was discharged to rehab.  Depression and poor coping 
were felt to play a major contribution to his symptoms and a 
palliative care consult was placed to discuss long term goals of 
care.  It was determiend that the patient would go to rehab and 
if continued to have progressive decline a move towards comfort 
focus care would be made.
.
#ESRD:  Patient missed his scheduled dialysis due to 
non-compliance per his family's report.  He was dialysised 
according to his normal schedule while and inpatient and had a 
mild improvement in his symptoms of weakness.  Patient continued 
to recieve all his usual renal medications.
.
#Systolic CHF:  patient has a EF of ___ on last ECHO from 
___ and stable cardiac exam.  Patient continued onaspirin, 
lisinopril, metoprolol while in house.
.
#CHIRRHOSIS:  patient with history of cardiac induced cirrhosis 
from chronic hepatic congestion.  Has had infectious as well as 
autoimmune workup for chirrohsis in the past which were 
negative.  No derangements in his liver function was observed 
and the patient recieved lactulose to treat any enchilitis that 
may have been contributing to his depression.
.
#CHRONIC PAIN: From compression fractures s/p fusion.  Will 
continue home dilaudid at 8 mg BID.
.
#RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME:  Stable, continued home gabapentin and 
ropinirole.  
.
#HTN:  Good systolic pressures at this time, will continue 
lisinopril.  
.
#HYPOTHYROID:  will continue synthroid per home dosing as TSH 
was not elevated.
.
#COPD:  Lungs clear on exam and CXR w/o no respiratory 
complaints, will continue titropium and albuterol.
.
#DEPRESSION:  Patient's depression was identified as a major 
barrier to his longterm care needs, he was continued on his home 
buproprion and clonazepam.  Activating medications including 
ritalin were entertained, but felt that his underlying cardiac 
and liver disease percluded its use.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
-Primary nephrologist raised issue of future neuro-cognative 
testing
-patient is a full code, but should be reassed as his chronic 
issues continue to evolve
-Palliative care consultation was placed to address future, 
needs patient still wishes to persue treatment of chronic issues 
at this time
-patinet's blood cultures were pending, but no growth at the 
time of discharge.

ECHO ___: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. 
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 
%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with 
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened with 
restricted leaflet motion or systolic doming. No pulmonic 
stenosis is appreciated. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is 
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the right ventricle now appears dilated and hypokinetic. The 
other findings are similar.  

CT ABD/PELVIS ___:  1. Limited study demonstrates diffuse and 
extensive anasarca, ascites. 2. Large bilateral pleural 
effusions, with associated atelectasis. 3. Interval decrease in 
left-sided retroperitoneal fluid collection, without visible 
internal loculations or gas. No definite focal, circumscribed 
fluid collection separate from this to suggest abscess. 4. No 
gross bony destruction to suggest osteomyelitis. 5. Possible 
decubitus ulcer. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
OVERALL SUMMARY OF STAY:
<br> Mr. ___ presented to ___ on ___ with altered mental 
status, hypotension, and respiratory failure as well as fever 
and leukocytosis.  He was grossly fluid overloaded at 
presentation with whole-body anasarca and large bilateral 
pleural effusions.  The source of his infection was not clear as 
he had multiple possible sources for infection including 
previous MSSA paraspinous abscess, a PICC line which had been in 
place for several weeks, a known intraabdominal fluid collection 
and recent diarrheal illness.  However, scans did not reveal any 
paraspinous abscess, blood cultures from the PICC were negative, 
C. diff labs were negative, and scans showed that the abdominal 
fluid collection had decreased in size; therefore the source of 
the infection was not clear though it resolved rather quickly 
after hospitalization and antibiotics.
He was treated with vancomycin/cefipime(changed to 
ceftazidime)and briefly needed to be on pressors for 
hypotension.  He was intubated from presentation until ___fter extubation without significant further 
respiratory distress.  His fever and leukocytosis resolved with 
antibiotics.  He received dialysis by HD, CVVH with UF, then HD 
again and this greatly improved his anasarca; he also received 
bilateral thoracentesis which were transudative.  After 
extubation he did well from a respiratory and hemodynamic 
standpoint.  He was in the MICU until ___ at which point he was 
stable and discharged to the floor. On the floor, pt has been 
stable and tolerating HD MWF well.  Pt will finish 14 day course 
of Vancomycin and Ceftazidime on ___ just prior to discharge 
to rehab.  

<br> HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
<br> Respiratory failure: Patient presented with decreased 
breathing and was intubated from ___ until ___.  The most 
likely etiology of his respiratory failure was thought to be 
both his septic picture and infection at presentation 
(fever/leukocytosis) as well as his acute on chronic heart 
failure (baseline L heart failure with new R heart failure at 
presentation) leading to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.  
His significant pleural effusions at presentation which likely 
contributed heavily to his respiratory difficulty.  As he was 
diuresed and dialyzed, fluid status improved and his respiratory 
status also improved.  He was extubated on ___ and did well 
from a respiratory standpoint; he was weaned to NC by ___.  He 
had a brief episode of desaturation to high 80's while on HD on 
___ and was given non-rebreather and came back to 100%; was 
then able to be weaned back to NC.  Lower extremity US were 
performed to assess for DVT ___ and these results were 
negative.  On floor, pt was weaned to RA and was discharged with 
O2 sat 92% on RA. 

<br> Fever and leukocytosis: Patient presented febrile and with 
high WBC count as well as hypotension, c/w a septic picture.  
There were multiple possible sources for infection including his 
old PICC line, his known paraspinal abscess, his history of 
recent intraabdominal fluid collection, and recent diarrhea.  He 
came to the hospital on nafcillin and this was switched to 
vancomycin given the possibility that he had MRSA not covered by 
previous outpatient regimen.  He was also started on 
ciprofloxacin and zosyn given the possibility of anaerobic 
infection ___ abdominal source; this was changed to vancomycin 
and cefipime per ID recs. Flagyl was started given the 
possibility of C. diff or other gut flora as evidenced by his 
diarrhea; this was D/C when 3X C. diff were negative.  The 
patient was kept on a 2-week of vancomycin and cefipime 
(cefipime switched to ceftazidime on ___.  Cultures obtained 
from the HD catheter and the PICC were negative.  A femoral 
arterial line was placed on ___ and central line placement was 
attempted on ___, however this placement was not successful.  
Because of this, his PICC was left in place until he was 
hemodynamically stable.  Femoral A-line was pulled on ___ and 
PICC was pulled on ___.  MRI of T and C spine was obtained per 
ortho to search for any other possible areas of spinal 
osteomyelitis, and though MRIs were not ideal because of 
movement artifact, they showed no new paraspinous abscess or 
fluid collection.  CTs of the T and L spine also showed no 
paraspinous abscess or fluid collection.  Overall after his 
initial presentation with fever and leukocytosis, his WBC 
trended downward and he had no significant fevers.  He completed 
a 14 day course of ceftazidime and vancomycin on ___. 

<br> Pleural effusions: Patient has a history of pleural 
effusions but CXR read at presentation showed worsened effusions 
compared to prior.  He had daily CXRs to monitor and was 
dialyzed as BP tolerated. Though he did not spike further fevers 
and WBC were stable, his pleural effusions persisted throughout 
his MICU stay despite HD and ultrafiltration.  On ___ the 
possibility of therapeutic bilateral thoracentesis was 
considered with the patient and his family.  R thoracentesis on 
___ was traumatic and appeared exudative with eosinophilia.  L 
thoracentesis on ___ was non-traumatic and transudative; it was 
thought that the R ___ showed false values due to ?tap 
technique and possible old blood in R pleura.  Gram stain and 
culture of both the R and L pleural fluid was negative.  The 
most likely etiology of the effusions was still thought to be 
volume overload (confirmed by physical exam and CXR as well as 
the second ___ results).

<br> Cardiomyopathy/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: 
Patient had a known EF of ___ (based on echo ___ at 
presentation, and a BNP was >70,000.  There was no prior BNP for 
comparison.  He also had a troponin of 0.48 at presentation 
which increased slightly to 0.51 on ___.  These were thought to 
be primarily due to demand ischemia given his probable 
infection.  There were no concerning EKG changes.  Troponins 
were measured and trended down (repeat troponin on ___ was 
0.48).  He had an echo on ___ which showed new RV dilation and 
hypokinesis not seen on the ___ Echo, as well as other 
findings consistent with his ___ echo including mild left 
atrial enlargement, mild symmetric LVH, severe LV hypokinesis 
and an EF ~20% as well as mild MR, significant pulmonic 
regurgitation and trivial pericardial effusion.  This new R 
heart failure could be either a result of his known L heart 
systolic failure or the result of new R heart strain.  CTA was 
performed to rule out PE and this showed no evidence of PE but 
did confirm large bilateral pleural effusions.  Fluid was 
removed as BP tolerated during his ___ hemodialysis.  Patient 
was started on captopril 6.25 TID on ___ for further management 
of heart failure (rather than metoprolol because he was still 
hypotensive at this point). He had a history of HTN at home 
treated with 50mg metoprolol TID.  His metoprolol was restarted 
at 12.5mg TID on ___ when pressures came back up.  Since his 
pressure and heart rate were still high on ___, this was 
increased to 25mg TID and he remained on this for the rest of 
his hospital stay.  

<br> ESRD on HD: Patient was very volume overloaded at 
presentation, and extremely edematous.  This was thought to be 
the likely source of his respiratory compromise.  He was 
maintained on ___ hemodialysis.  After receiving HD on ___ and 
___ the renal team felt that ultrafiltration would be useful to 
take more fluid off in the setting of his hypotension on HD but 
his persistent fluid-overloaded state.  He was placed on CVVH 
from ___ and this was successful at removing large 
quantities of fluid.  Patient appeared much less anasarcic after 
CVVH.  This was switched to HD with ultrafiltration on ___ (his 
regular ___ schedule) since his pressures had stabilized and his 
clinical exam had improved. 

<br> Tachycardia: Patient was persistently in sinus tachycardia 
to the 110s-120s during the latter part of his MICU stay.  This 
was thought to be due to heart failure placing him on the 
descending limb of the Starling curve so that his fluid overload 
put strain on his heart and cardiac output was low, leading to 
tachycardia.  He also was anemic which could have contributed.  
He had a history of hypothyroidism treated with synthroid and 
TSH was checked for the possibility that renal failure and fluid 
shifts led to increased levels of synthroid causing a 
hyperthyroid picture; however TSH was slightly elevated c/w mild 
hypothyroidism.  His tachycardia persisted but at lower levels 
(low 100s)on ___. 

<br> Altered Mental Status: Paient presented with decreased 
mentation from his baseline.  It was thought that his altered 
mental status was primarily ___ infection given his leukocytosis 
and fever.  He did also have a known history of hypoglycemia in 
the setting of being hospitalized.  A glucose at presentation 
was 59 and he was given ___ amp D50 with an improvement in 
mental status.  Finger sticks were normal through the rest of 
his hospital stay, and infection was treated as per above.  
Patient's mental status improved significantly after extubation 
and weaning of sedation.

<br> Paraspinal Abscess: Patient presented with known paraspinal 
abscess.  Initial plan when this abscess was discovered was to 
have an 8-week course of nafcillin.  he had initially been on 
rifampin as well, but this was stopped on ___ given his 
worsening LFTs.  At the time of admission, patient was put on 
the antibiotic regimen described above, i.e. switched from 
nafcillin to vancomycin given signs of infection (fever and 
leukocytosis) in the setting of already being on nafcillin.  
Leukocytosis and fevers improved as per above.

<br> Diarrhea: Patient had a history of loose stools at a 
previous admission which were attributed to his bowel regimen 
and his low albumin.  At the time of this admission, he was 
cultured for C. diff X3 and all cultures were negative. He was 
started on flagyl at the time of initial admission, and this was 
continued until ___ when the ___ C. diff culture returned 
negative.  His home loperamide was held.

<br> Decubitus ulcer on buttocks: Patient had state II decub 
ulcers on buttocks and a healing wound from recent spinal 
surgery.  He had flexiseal dressings placed to protect, and 
wound care consult saw him.

<br> Anemia: Thought to be likely ___ his ESRD.  Iron studies 
were repeated and he received epogen at HD.  He did have a Hct 
drop on ___ from 29.9 to 26.0 and repeat Hcts during the next 
few days showed Hct persistently low in the ___ range.  Iron 
studies were repeated and showed low iron and high TIBC c/w iron 
deficiency anemia. On ___, pt had Hct  20.9 and was given 1 
unit PRBCs with rise in HCt to 24.2. HCT is 25.3 at time of 
discharge.

<br> Pain: Patient was on methadone as a home regimen.  This was 
decreased at presentation to 5mg TID given his altered mental 
status.  He did complain of abdominal pain during his stay, and 
amylase and lipase were checked on ___ these were normal. Per 
previous records this abdominal pain has been a longstanding 
issue.  Patient was culture for C. diff as per above.  By ___ 
the patient was no longer complaining of abdominal pain.

<br> HTN: patient has a history of HTN was on home metoprolol.  
This was held in the setting of his septic picture with hypoTN 
requiring pressors, and he was monitored for reflex tachycardia. 
 Levophed was started at admission and was able to be weaned and 
turned off by ___.  Captopril was started on ___ as per above 
(for his cardiac failure rather than for hyperTN as he was still 
hypotensive at this point).  His home metoprolol was restarted 
on ___ and titrated up as tolerated because his pressures had 
slowly increased to the 120s and he was tachycardic to the 
100s-110s. He remained slightly tachycardic for the rest of his 
stay but his pressures were in the normal range and he was not 
hypertensive.   

<br> CAD with positive stress test ___: Patient was maintained 
on ASA 325mg daily, plan was to restart metoprolol when his BP 
would tolerate.  Echo was repeated as per above. Captopril and 
metoprolol started as per above.

<br> Restless leg syndrome: Patient's home mirtazipine was held 
given his altered mental status at presentation.

<br> Psoriasis: treated with sarna lotion PRN

<br> Hypothyroid: Patient's home synthroid was increased to 62.5 
mcg from 50 this hospital stay after TSH slightly elevated at 
5.4 (ULN 4.2) with a free T4 of 0.8.  Pt's TSH should be 
rechecked in ___ wks to ensure appropriate dosing.  

<br> FEN: Patient was kept NPO until ___ at which point his tube 
feeds were restarted per nutrition recommendations.  Lytes were 
repleted PRN.  He was started back on a PO diet on ___ and 
advanced as tolerated per speech and swallow recs (no gag reflex 
on initial assessment, but was able to be advanced with no signs 
of choking).
