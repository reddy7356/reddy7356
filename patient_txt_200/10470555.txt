(___) 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
On ___, she underwent laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy and 
open ventral
hernia repair with polypropylene mesh. The peritoneal cavity was 
surveilled noting multiple small white nodules on the abdominal 
wall peritoneum just adjacent
to the liver in the right upper quadrant. An area of the 
peritoneum in the right upper quadrant that contained multiple 
of these nodules was excised. This biopsy read by pathology was 
consistent with carcinomatosis. A large liver tumor was noted. 
Given biopsy findings, further resection of the tumor was 
aborted. Surgeon was Dr. ___. Please refer to 
operative note for details. 

Postop, pain was initially managed with an epidural. Vital signs 
were stable. The foley was removed, however, she had urinary 
retention and the foley was replaced. This was removed 6 hours 
after the epidural was removed on ___ and she was able to void. 
Diet was advanced and tolerated. Oxycodone was started after the 
epidural was removed and this was well tolerated. 

Dr. ___ met with the patient and her son to communicate the 
operative findings via a ___ interpreter. She was also 
presented at the weekly tumor conference. The plan was for her

CT to be done 
on ___ per ___// ___ year old woman with HCC, s/p TACE, 
noncontrast CT to 
be done on ___ per ___. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT images of the abdomen were acquired 
without 
intravenous contrast. Non-contrast scan has several limitations 
in detecting 
vascular and parenchymal organ abnormalities, including tumor 
detection. 
No oral contrast was administered. 
Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on 
PACS.

COMPARISON:  MRI dated ___.  CT dated ___. 
  
FINDINGS:  
  
LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits.  
There is no 
evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. 
  
ABDOMEN: 
  
HEPATOBILIARY: Post TACE of large, exophytic hepatic mass which 
is markedly 
larger than on prior now measuring 17 cm, previously 9 cm.  
There is lipiodol 
deposition predominantly involving segments V and VI, with 
lipiodol seen in 
the periphery of the large mass and to a lesser degree in 
segment ___. 
  
Gas is noted within the inferior aspect of the mass, which is 
inseparable from 
the hepatic flexure, concerning for fistulization of the mass 
with the 
adjacent large bowel (3:81). 
  
There is no biliary dilatation.  There is vicarious excretion of 
contrast 
within the gallbladder. 
  
PANCREAS: Unremarkable. 
  
SPLEEN: Unremarkable. 
  
ADRENALS:  A 2.0 x 2.3 cm left adrenal nodule contains fat and 
is consistent 
with an adenoma.  A second left adrenal nodule measures 1.1 x 
0.9 cm and is 
indeterminate, but stable.  The right adrenal gland is 
unremarkable. 
  
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size.  A 1.5 cm 
exophytic 
mass in the upper pole of the left kidney, and a 6 mm 
hypodensity in the upper 
pole of the left kidney were previously characterized on MR as 
angiomyolipomas.  There is excreted contrast in the bilateral 
collecting 
systems.  There is no hydronephrosis. 
  
GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a moderate hiatal hernia.  There is 
no bowel 
obstruction.  There is no ascites. 
  
LYMPH NODES: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal or 
mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions. 
  
SOFT TISSUES: There is a high-density fluid collection in the 
anterior 
abdominal wall, at the site of ventral hernia repair, likely 
representing a 
hematoma. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
Status post TACE of a large, exophytic right hepatic mass which 
has markedly 
increased size, and demonstrates findings concerning for 
fistulization with 
the large bowel at the hepatic flexure. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with hx of HCC (bx proven, with peritoneal mets), htn, HLD, 
IDDM2, CAD s/p stent x2 (>1 decade ago), RCC s/p cryoablation, 
infrarenal aortic dissection presenting for
monitoring after tranarterial chemoembolization.

# HCC, with peritoneal carcinomatosis:
# S/p TACE: She tolerated the procedure well with mild 
post-procedure abdominal pain and nausea. She was placed on the 
post TACE protocol. The nausea and abdominal pain resolved 
following the procedure and she tolerated a diet. Her post 
procedure CT scan was read as concern for fistulazation between 
the mass and the hepatic flexure of the colon. This was 
discussed with interventional radiology who felt that it was an 
overcall given expected post TACE findings and there was no 
fistula. Her abdominal exam was unremarkable and she was stable 
for discharge. Metformin is on hold for 48 hours post procedure 
given the potential interaction with IV contrast. She will 
follow up in ___ clinic in 6 days.  

# IDDM2: Home regimen is glargine 44u qAM and 30u qHS, and 
Humalog SS. Last HbA1c 8.1% on ___, which is reasonable 
target in setting of active malignancy. She will resume her home 
medications in discharge with the exception of her metformin 
which will be helpd for 48 hours post procedure as above. 

# Hypertension: Continued home amlodipine

# CAD: 
- Continued home Metoprolol with hold parameters
- Continued home ___
- On simvastatin 40 mg and amlodipine - Given TACE hold home 
simvastatin but would consider change to atorvastatin given 
interaction. Please follow up with PCP. 

# ___ edema: Pt reports chronic ___ edema with furosemide prn, 
subtle R>L. Pt is unsure if this asymmetry is chronic. ___ 
obtained and was negative. Continued PRN Lasix at home. 

Greater than 30 minutes was spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with metastatic 
HCC, s/p TACE most recently sorafenib, who initially presented 
with fatigue, found to have worsening hyperbilirubinemia and ___ 
on admission. With T. bili 2.1 on admission that trended up to 
5.9 during hospitalization, attributed to worsening metastatic 
disease progression with known extensive progression of hepatic 
disease on recent MRCP ___. ___ was also likely in the 
setting of worsening hepatic function with poor PO intake in 
several days prior to admission. Per ___, was not a candidate for 
PTBD with no intervenable lesion identified on MRCP. Antibiotics 
were deferred given lower suspicion for cholangitis. After 
extensive goals of care conversation with primary oncologist Dr. 
___, patient was transitioned to home with hospice prior

sorafenib.

# ___ - Initially with ___ on admission Cr 1.5. Was thought to 
be pre-renal give concurrent hyponatremia of 133 with history of 
poor PO intake and also from hyperuricemia per below with uric 
acid 14.6 on admission. Was thought to be intravascularly 
depleted with extravascular volume overload given chronic lower 
extremity edema. Given hypoalbuminemic, was administered albumin 
50 x 2 doses. Creatinine trended up to 1.7, prior to discharge. 
Did not pursue additional diagnostic workup or intervention 
given goals of care per above and plan for discharge home with

hypertension and evaluation of an infrarenal aortic dissection 
as well as, a liver mass found on an abdominal CTA.  This was 
performed after patient complained of severe right sided 
abdominal pain x 1 week.  She was admitted to the vascular 
surgery service and transferred to the ICU for strict blood 
pressure monitoring.  Her blood pressure was well controlled on 
esmolol and nicardipine drips.  She was easily transitioned to 
PO medications consisting of metoprolol and amlodipine, 
maintaining her SBP less than 140.  She was transferred to the 
vascular surgery floor on hospital day 2.  

Patient underwent and MRI of the liver w/ and w/o contrast, 
further demonstrating the size of the liver mass and possible 
renal mass.  Her PCP was contacted with the information on these 
findings and an appointment was made for follow-up.

focal infrarenal aortic dissection.  There is no aneurysmal 
degeneration and there is good flow beyond this area to the 
iliac arteries.  She will require a follow up CTA and an 
appointment with vascular surgery in 6 months. In addition, she 
will need regular blood pressure checks and follow up of her new 
antihypertensive regimen with her PCP.
