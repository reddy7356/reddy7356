Brief Hospital Course:
#Ventriculomegaly
The patient was admitted following uncomplicated placement of R 
VP shunt ___ strata set to 2.0 ___ 
ventriculomegaly on ___. For details of the procedure, please 
refer to Dr. ___ operative note. The patient was 
extubated and transferred to the PACU without incident. While in 
the PACU, the patient was noted to be neurologically intact. 
Post-operative CT was performed and revealed no evidence of 
hemorrhage or infarct with satisfactory placement of the 
catheter tip in the frontal horn of the right lateral ventricle. 
The patient was subsequently transferred to the ___ for further 
monitoring, where she underwent q2hr neurologic checks. On POD1, 
the patient ambulated OOB and tolerated sips. However, her 
ability to tolerate PO intake was limited due to ongoing nausea, 
which was treated with Zofran and scopolamine to good effect. It 
was felt the scopolamine patch may have cause confusion 
post-operatively and was d/c'd with improvement in the patient's 
mental status and did not result in worsening nausea. Here 
neurologic exam remained stable for the remaineder of her 
hospital course. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was neurologically intact; 
all surgical sites were C/D/I without evidence of induration, 
erythema, or swelling. 

#Pre-renal azotemia
The patient initially failed to void following surgery. There 
was no evidence of urinary retention on bladder scan. However, 
her urine output was borderline low (actual: 20 cc/hr, expected 
27 cc/hr) in the setting of prerenal azotemia (BUN 25/Cr 0.8 = 
31.25). Given poor PO intake in the setting of nausea, she 
continued IV hydration with NS @ 75 mL/hr and received a 500 cc 
NS bolus on POD1, after which she voided on POD1 evening.

#DM1
The patient continued home insulin pump post-operatively. The 
___ service was consulted and recommended increased basal 
insulin rate as well as sliding scale, as patient was 
hyperglycemic (SBP ~240s) and questionably confused with 
inability to self manage. The patient self d/c'd her pump on 
___ and she was started on Lantus daily and continued on 
insulin sliding scale per ___ recommendation. Her blood 
sugars were labile while off the insulin pump. She received her 
last dose of Lantus on ___ and re-initiated use of her insulin 
pump on the morning of ___.  She continued to do well with her 
pump and was monitored until the morning of ___ when settings 
were adjusted and she was discharged to rehab.  

#Hyponatremia: Patient has chronically low sodium (records as 
far back as ___ however in the setting of her post-operative 
confusion she was started on sodium tabs 1G TID, which was 
increased to 2g TID and had normotremia on discharge.  Her 
sodium tabs may be weaned as tolerated. Her mag, phos and 
calcium were also repleted PRN. 

#Confusion
The patient was noted to be mildly confused on POD1 evening. 
Neurologic exam was otherwise intact. U/A was sent to rule out 
UTI and negative. Confusion resolved after discontinuation of 
scopolamine patch. 

#Disopostion: 
Patient was evaluated by ___ and OT who recommended rehab. Case 
management was involved to work on bed placement.

ON DISCHARGE
Cranial Nerves - on primary gaze there is ABduction of the right 
eye, but no ADduction. The left eye is down and abducted and 
there is a persistent torsional nystagumus of the left eye with 
a vertical nystagmus as well. On left lateral gaze she has full 
abduction of the left, but the right eye does not adduct past 
midline. On right lateral gaze she can completely abduct the 
right eye and adduct the left eye. When individual eyes are 
closed the left eye has full EOM. The right eye has no ability 
to adduct. Her diplopia is most significant on left lateral gaze 
and resolves on right lateral gaze.

Gait: with her eye patched she has some difficulty ambulating 
but is able to walk without the aid of an assistive device.
 
Pertinent Results:
MRI: ___
1. Foci of increased DWI signal within the brainstem are too 
small to 
definitively characterize but may represent very small lacunar 
infarcts. 
2. No other acute findings. 

MRI ___ w/ fine cuts through the brainstem: several small 
midline pontine and lower midbrain infarcts (acute)

TTE: ___
No intracardiac source of embolism identified. Normal global and 
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild to moderate 
mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary hypertension.  

HgA1c: 6.7
LDL ___iplopia
Ms. ___ was admitted to the stroke service after having sudden 
onset of double vision and difficulty walking. On examination 
she was found to have significant eye movement abnormalities as 
detailed below: on primary gaze there is an Abduction of the 
right, but right eye cannot adduct and left eye shows a 
horizontal nystagmus with vertical component on left lateral 
gaze. Otherwise, the nystagmus of the left eye seems to be 
primarily a vertical nystagmus (upbeating with a torsional 
component). In addition, she has a skew deviation with left eye 
slightly lower and out compared to the right eye. When 
individual eyes are closed the left eye has full EOM. The right 
eye has no ability to adduct. Her diplopia is most significant 
on left lateral gaze and resolves on right lateral gaze.

The likely etiology for this was an acute small vessel 
infarction of the brainstem localizing most likely close to the 
right ___ nuclei affecting the part of the ___ nucleus on the 
right that governs the right adductor and hitting fibers from 
the superior rectus of the left eye causing the skew deviation 
and the vertical nystagmus as gaze paretic nystagmus. An MRI was 
performed which showed some DWI abnormalities in the midportion 
of the upper pons and power midbrain which were very small.

She was on cilostazol and aspirin when she was admitted. We 
changed her medications to aspirin 81 and added plavix 75 daily. 
We told her to patch her eye and switch the patch intermittently 
to help with the diplopia. She will follow up in clinic with Dr. 
___.

admission. They felt no changes were necessary.

Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt

Surgery
•You underwent surgery to remove the distal portion of your VP 
shunt due to infection. The remainder of the shunt remains in
