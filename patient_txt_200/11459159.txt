MICROBIOLOGY:

EMERGENCY WARD 

IMAGING:
___ CXR: Since the prior chest radiograph of 2 days 
earlier, the patient has been extubated.  Lungs are 
well-expanded and clear with no findings to suggest acute 
aspiration or aspiration pneumonia 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Small amount of hemorrhage in the 
left posterior perimesencephalic cistern.  This may be a 
consequence of recent trauma.  Consider follow-up CT to exclude 
further hemorrhage.  The study is otherwise normal. 

___ TTE IMPRESSION: Low normal global left ventricular 
systolic function. Mildly dilated ascending aorta. No clinically 
significant valvular disease. Normal pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yoM with history of alcohol abuse who was found down after 
drinking alcohol, transferred from outside hospital intubated, 
sedated and cooled without clear evidence of ischemia or 
pulselessness, who was transferred to the medical floor from the 
ICU for further management. Overall, his presentation was 
thought to be most consistent with alcohol intoxication. His 
serum ethanol level was 128, troponins were negative x3, he was 
not orthostatic, and had no clinical evidence of infection. 
However, given EKG showing ~1mm STE in leads V3-V5, TTE was 
performed to rule out myocardial infarction. TTE showed 
low-normal global systolic function without wall motion 
abnormalities, making MI unlikely. Lipid panel did show 
hyperlipidemia and he was started on rosuvastatin, later 
switched to losuvastatin given coverage by ___. 

Patient was monitored on CIWA protocol with diazepam and scored 
for agitation, anxiety, tremors, and sweating. Patient was also 
noted to be confused, confabulating and with gait ataxia during 
admission. There was some concern for Wernicke encephalopathy. 
He was started on thiamine 500 IV TID for 2 days and received 
one dose of thiamine 250 IV prior to discharge home. He will 
need to continue high dose oral thiamine treatment till ___. 
His mental status and gait improved by time of discharge, and he 
was no longer experiencing signs of withdrawal. He is to 
continue daily thiamine at home.

Repeat CT head imaging showed a small amount of hemorrhage in 
the left posterior perimesencephalic cistern thought to be due 
to trauma. Neurosurgery was consulted and did not recommend 
further imaging or surgical intervention.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Patient to take 300mg thiamine x4d until ___ followed by 
thiamine 100mg qd for one month for Wernicke encephalopathy. 
Please continue monitoring mental status. 
- Patient was started on losuvastatin (given coverage by ___ 
pharmacy), however any statin that is affordable can be 
prescribed 
- Other new medications: ASA 81, B12, multivitamin, nicotine 
patch
