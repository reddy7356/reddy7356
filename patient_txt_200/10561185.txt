ECG: SR at 91 with normal axis and intervals. No pathologic Q 
waves. No ECG available for comparison.
.
ECHO ___ left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are 
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal 
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated 
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild 
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No 
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen 
(within normal limits). There is moderate to severe pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate to severe 
pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular dilation and mild 
dysfunction. Preserved global left ventricular systolic 
function. Elevated estimated left ventricular filling pressures.

can be compared to prior radiographs, if available, otherwise a 
chest CT may be obtained for further evaluation

ct chest-IMPRESSION: 
1. No perihilar mass or lymphadenopathy. The radiographic 
appearance of the

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:  
___ year old woman admitted with reports of DOE, leg swelling, 
found to have a HCT of 14 with iron deficiency anemia. 
(transfused 4units prbcs, guaiac negative, EGD showing GAVE. 
ECHO showing severe Pulm HTN with RV dilation.  
.  
# Iron deficiency anemia/GAVE: Ferritin 1.7, iron 8. REtic 3%. 
Hemolysis labs were negative, TTG negative. Pt was given 4 units 
of PRBCs. EGD found GAVE and pt was treated with argon beam and 
started on BID PPI and sucralfate. Pt's HCT has remained stable. 
Last HCT 27.6 and there were no signs of active bleeding. Pt was 
guaiac negative. Pt was started on PO iron. Discussed diagnosis 
and treatment plan with the patient. She will have GI follow up 
in 2 weeks time with repeat EGD in ___ weeks with repeat Argon 
beam. A benign appearing polyp was found on colonoscopy and 
biopsy was taken. Pt will follow up results at ___. 
Malignancy work up negative thus far. Rheumatology w/u showed 
___ 1:320 and rheumatology was consulted for possible 
rheumatologic condition such as system sclerosis that could 
cause GAVE, Pulm HTN, and arthralgia. See below. Pt should have 
serial HCt's monitored in the outpatient setting.
.  
# Pulmonary hypertension: Cardiology was consulted and feels 
that that pulm htn is likely secondary to chronic mild hypoxia 
from anemia and sleep apnea. Cardiology suggested a repeat echo 
in a few weeks time to eval for changes after treatment for 
anemia and possible sleep apnea (with sleep study and possible 
bypap). If findings are persistent pt could have a cardiology 
follow up arranged. Her Hbaic, lipid panel, LFTs, Rfactor were 
all negative. Pt did not require any supplement oxygen. Pt 
should have a sleep study arranged as an outpatient.
.  
# acute Congestive systolic Heart Failure, right sided: Pt 
presented with volume overload and peripheral edema (albumin, 
TSH, Lfts and renal fxn were normal). Echo showed R.sided heart 
failure/pulm HTn. This was thought to be related to pulmonary 
HTN as above. Pt was given IV lasix with good effect. Weight 
dropped 6lbs and her volume status has improved. Pt was not 
diuresed in last 2 days prior to discharge. She was not 
discharged on lasix. She can continue to have her volume status 
monitored in the outpatient setting.  She was placed on a low 
sodium diet and asked to continue this in the outpatient 
setting. Nutrition was consulted for education. 
.  
# auto immune process?/Mild arthralgia and stiffness in the neck 
and shoulders. Plain films ordered and show degenerative 
changes. CT of the neck shows degenerative change. Pt also 
reported "Creaky" hips and knees. This was all thought to be 
related to OA. RF was negative, CK normal, ESR was normal. 
However, ___ returned positive with titer 1:320 and rheumatology 
was consulted for further eval as above in the event that pt's 
current presentation could be related to an autoimmune process 
(pulm HTN, Gave, arthralgias). Pt was given tylenol for pain 
control. She will have the remained of her rheumatologic panel 
followed up as an outpatient. 
.  
# Depression: Pt reported significant depression over last ___ 
years after death of her mother. She denies SI. Pt also had 
difficulty with anxiety and insomnia this admission. SW was 
consulted and followed the patient. Discussed treatment options 
with the patient including therapy and medications. Pt declines 
medications at this time. She would like to continue social work 
and therapy in the outpatient setting.
.  
# 50 lb weight loss-patient reported that this was intentional 
over ___ years. CXR, Chest CT negative for malignancy. Abd and 
Pelvis CT scan were negative for malignancy as was ___. Pt 
urged and encouraged to continue age appropriate cancer 
screening such as mammogram, pap smear and pelvic exam in the 
outpatient setting. She was started on vitamin D and Calcium. 
.
#hiatial hernia-Pt noticed the have this on imaging. She does 
not have symptoms of GERD or any abominal pain or other 
symptoms. Imaging did not show incarceration. Pt will take a PPI 
for the above. She can continue to follow up as an outpatient as 
needed or if symptoms develop.
.  
FEN: low sodium, heart healthy. 
.  
 
Medications on Admission:
She takes no medications, herbs, or supplements.

Brief Hospital Course:
TASKS FOR OUTPATIENT ___:
-- PCP ___
-- GI ___, recommend EGD in 2 months

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  This is a ___ woman with a history 
signficant for gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), lower 
extremity edema, pulmonary HTN, and chronic neck & back pain who 
was admitted for anemia, GI bleeding, palpitations, and 
worsening edema likely due to continued bleeding from vascular 
ectasia.

# FE DEFICIENCY ANEMIA SECONDARY TO GAVE: The patient's was 
found to have drop in her baseline Hct (22 on admission), in the 
setting of palpitations, and guaiac positive stools. Her anemia 
was presumed to be due continued bleeding from her known 
vascular ectasia and was verified with upper endoscopy 
demonstrating multiple angioectasia in a watermelon pattern that 
were then obliterated with argon plasma coagulation. The patient 
received 1 unit PRBCs, after which her Hct responded 
appropriately and she remained hemodynamically stable. Iron 
studies demonstrated Fe 11, Ferritin 4.9, TIBC 313. She was also 
started on folic acid and Vitamin B12, and continued on her home 
dosages of omeprazole and iron supplementation. At discharge, 
patient had a Hct 28.2, was asymptomatic without complaints of 
palpitations and had no evidence of blood in her stool. 
  
# LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA: The patient's chronic lower extremity 
edema is likely due to her known pulmonary HTN. Evidence of 
dilated RV, hyperdynamic LV function and moderate to severe 
pulmonary hypertension on ECHO in ___. Cardiac, hepatic and 
renal etiologies of her edema were unlikely. She had bilateral 
edema, without evidence of pulmonary congestion on exam or CXR 
at admission, or an elevated JVP. Her liver transaminases at 
admission and last serum albumin in ___ were both within 
normal limits. Additionally, she has not had any evidence of 
proteinuria in the past. The acute worsening likely due 
inactivity secondary to her chronic neck and back pain. Patient 
was continued on home dosage of lasix, maintained on a 2 gm/day 
sodium diet, and encouraged to keep her legs elevated.
  
# CHRONIC PAIN: Stable throughout hospitalization with no acute 
issues. Patient was continued on her home dosage of toradol.
 
Communication was maintained with the patient and she remained 
full code throught her hospitalization.

therapy (the same as last time you were here).  Your blood count 
increased after the transfusion and stayed stable.

No changes were made to your medication, you should continue all 
your home medication as previously directed.

Please be sure to keep all your follow up appointments as below.
