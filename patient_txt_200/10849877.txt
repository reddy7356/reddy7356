Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to Deac 4 on conditional voluntary basis.  She 
remained in behavioral control throughout her hospital stay and 
participated in treatment.  No medication changes were made, as 
pt was in the process of tapering off Paxil and desired further 
psychopharm evaluation by new outpt psychiatrist (to which she 
was referred by time of discharge). She was placed on MVI, 
thiamine, folate and a CIWA, but required no benzodiazepins for 
detox. Individual and group therapy focused on improving coping 
skills, which pt found helpful, with a decrease in urges for SIB 
(be it cutting or binge drinking).
