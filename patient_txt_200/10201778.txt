___ Unilateral Lower Extremity Veins Doppler
Imaging:
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Right lower extremity swelling, rule out 
DVT. 
  
COMPARISON: None. 
  
TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: There is normal respirophasic waveform 
in the 
bilateral common femoral veins. There is normal compressibility, 
response to augmentation, and color Doppler flow within the 
right common femoral, 
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. Normal flow is seen 
within the 
posterior tibial and peroneal veins of the calf. 
  
IMPRESSION: No evidence of left lower extremity DVT. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ PMH of chronic lymphedema of the legs bilaterally 
(unknown cause) with presents with cellulitis of the left leg.

in the ED with improvement in the erythema. He had no signs of

pain of the left lower leg and was afebrile. He reported being

cultures pending at the time of discharge.  There was concern

negative for clot.

#CKD- patient has an elevated Cr of 1.3 at baseline which was 
stable throughout his hospital course. His BP was stable and 
normotensive and nothing was done to work-up this elevated Cr, 
would recommend continuing to monitor for signs of worsening

blood clot.
