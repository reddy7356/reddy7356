History of Present Illness:
___ history of past acute pancreatitis in the setting of alcohol 
abuse and hypertriglyceridemia presents with abdominal bloating 
and discomfort. 

History taken from patient and ED documentation. He was last 
seen in ___ by GI as an outpatient for follow-up of his 
pancreatitis and a polypoid lesion in his stomach; their last 
document notes they contacted him with pathology results from an 
EGD ("Antral nodule biopsy: Ectopic pancreas with very focal 
overlying intestinal metaplasia. ___ dysplasia.") Since then, he 
has generally felt fine until a URI diagnosed 11 days ago for 
which he was started on Augmentin. He felt well enough to go to 
___ last ___ and ___ to fish and swim. He 
returned feeling well, and was working on a rooftop on ___ 
when it was very hot and he didn't feel right. He went home, 
stayed in ___, but continued to feel poorly so came in for 
medical attention. 

His symptoms are vague, but on direct questioning he's most 
worried about a swollen abdomen and inability to take PO. There 
is abdominal pain when he tries to eat or drink; more recently, 
he just "spits up" anything he tries to swallow. His PO and UOP 
have been down. His symptoms feel similar to his prior 
pancreatitis, but not quite the same. He has felt subjective 
fevers and chills. He has not had chest pain, shortness of 
breath, wheeze, cough since starting the antibiotic (he has one 
1 pill left). He was watery stools, but few, and ___ fecal 
incontinence or urge. ___ urinary issues. He is worried about 
Lyme because of a rash on his buttock that is pruritic.

splenic
infarcts.
3. Hepatic steatosis.

EKG showed: NSR, ___ ischemic change.

Patient was given:
___ 22:12 IV Morphine Sulfate 4 mg 
___ 22:12 IV Ondansetron 4 mg

___ w/ PMHx of pancreatitis p/w abdominal pain and bloating. 

# Splenic Infarcts: Patient presented with abdominal discomfort 
and has imaging findings concerning for  splenic infarcts. 
Multiple etiologies for this from embolic to endocarditis to 
infarcts in the setting of splenomegaly (which has been seen on
prior imaging the patient has likely due to prior episodes of 
pancreatitis and narrowing of the splenic vein). He initially 
had a leukocytosis but that has now resolved. He is non-toxic

or hemorrhage) that would need splenectomy or more aggressive 
management. His blood cultures had ___ growth after 48 hours and 
his cardiac echo was normal without valvular lesions. He was in 
NSR over the course of his stay on tele. He had mild 
thrombocytopenia that was improving at time of discharge (see 
below) but ___ other abnormalities on his CBC. He will follow up 
as an outpatient with hematology. 

# Thrombocytopenia: Likely consumptive in the setting of above 
splenic infarcts. Trending up on the day of discharge with last 
platelets of 112 (nadir of 86). 

# Hypertriglyceridemia: Elevated to 5500 on admission. Counseled 
on the need for diet, exercise and taking his home medications. 

# DM: He was maintained on an ISS while in the hospital but 
needed 4 units of insulin over his hospital stay. Would consider 
outpatient management. 

Greater than 30 minutes was spent in care coordination and

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with a history of severe 
familial hypertriglyceridemia (requiring plasmapheresis for 
pancreatitis in the past) w/ pancreatic pseudocyst who presented 
initially for elective ERCP axial stent placement between 
stomach and cyst to drain pancreatic pseudocyst with procedural 
course complicated by acute arterial UGIB 
   
He came as an outpatient to ERCP on ___, where ERCP performed 
an axial stent between his pancreatic pseudocyst and the 
stomach. Following plastic stent deployment and dilatation, 
there was subsequently active, pulsatile bleeding from the wall 
of the stomach. Attempted to inject the bleeding vessel with epi 
without significant response and aborted procedure. He was 
transferred to PACU and CTA was performed. CTA did not show 
active bleeding but because of arterial pulsatile bleeding ___ 
was pursued. ___ found gastric artery passing closely to stent 
but without blush so embolized the gastric artery empirically. 
   
While in ___, he had transient hypotension with SBPs in ___ and 
required pressors briefly. By the time they begun the procedure, 
he was off pressors and doing ___. There was no active bleeding 
visualized, but they observed that a branch of the L gastric 
artery ran near the newly placed stent. The L gastric artery was 
prophylactically embolized. No blood loss during procedure and 
no blood was given ___. From ___, he was 
transferred to the ___ for further management.
 
Intubated in ERCP suite then when to ___, then presented to ___ 
intubated around 8pm ___ evening. Weaned off pressors 
immediately, and extubated the morning of transfer ___. Did not 
receive any pRBCs. Did receive 1 L IVFs. During the day ___ he 
had 2 episodes of large volume dark clotted hematemesis and with 
stable hemodynamics. ERCP evaluated and felt it was old blood in 
the stomach or blood being evacuated from the pseudocyst. 
Following those 2 episodes, no issues occurred during the day, 
started eating and drinking by the afternoon. 

He was transferred to ___ on ___ from the ICU and further 
monitored. Cipro/Flagyl for 5 days started on ___, and the 
plan is PO BID PPI for 3 weeks until repeat CT in 3 weeks.

RELEVANT IMAGING
___ Imaging CHEST (PA & LAT)
Lung volumes are low.  Retrocardiac opacity with obscuring of 
the lateral border of the thoracic aorta on the frontal view and 
better seen on the lateral view with a spine sign may represent 
round atelectasis, although an acute process such as pneumonia 
cannot be completely excluded.  Linear plate-like band in the 
left lower lung is atelectasis. No pleural effusion.  No 
pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size.  No pulmonary edema. 
Retrocardiac opacity may reflect round atelectasis, however 
acute pneumonia cannot be excluded and recommend treatment with 
follow-up chest radiograph to ensure resolution.

___ Imaging ABDOMEN US 
IMPRESSION:  Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other 
forms of liver disease including hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis 
or steatohepatitis cannot be excluded on the basis of this 
examination. Mild splenomegaly.  
The gallbladder is unremarkable.  No cholelithiasis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with history of severe pancreatitis (___), HLD, HTG, 
presented with sudden onset abdominal pain consistent with acute 
pancreatitis.
 
#Pancreatitis:
Patient with a known history of hypertriglyceridemia and on 
admission reported not being compliant with his gemfibrozil and 
low fat diet. He had 4 beers the night before admission. His 
measured TAGs were 6190 and his Lipase was ___ on admission. 
Hypertriglyceridemia and possibly ETOH were the most likely 
triggers of his acute pancreatitis. His course was complicated 
by SIRS, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, mild pleural effusions 
with a BISAP of 2. He responded well to fluid resuscitation, 
bowel rest, anti emetics and Dilaudid. He did not have any 
clinical signs of pancreatic necrosis, superinfection or 
persistent end organ damage. He could tolerate PO by hospital 
day 3 and was was discharged on Oxycodone, gemfibrozil and 
regular low fat diet.  

# Alcohol use: 
Patient had a recent alcohol intake (4 beers the night before 
presentation), but denied excessive use. He also denied a 
history of complicated withdrawal symptoms. He was monitored on 
a CIWA scale and did not show any signs of withdrawal by the 
time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___. You came in 
with abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis. Your 
triglycerides were too high and we treated you with insulin and 
they were trending down by the time you were discharged. For the 
pancreatitis, we treated you with pain medications and bowel 
rest and your pain had decreased significantly by time of 
discharge.
Alcohol intake and high fat diet are the main risk factors for 
pancreatitis flares. Maintaining a low fat diet and taking your 
gemfibrozil will help decrease the chance of a recurrence. 
We recommend that you follow up with a lipid specialist and your 
primary care doctor to have better control of your 
triglycerides.
 
PLEASE CALL YOUR PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR TOMORROW TO SCHEDULE AN 
APPOINTMENT THIS WEEK!

We wish you a speedy recovery
Your ___ team

___ for pancreatitis with ongoing abdominal 
pain.

1. Pancreatitis: Severe, but no necrosis. ___ score ? 6 
given
pancreatic enhancement, peripancreatic inflammation, and 
extrapancreatic fluid collections. He was given aggressive IVF 
at 200 cc/hr, which was decreased then weaned off. His 
electrolytes were repleted. He was initially given iv pain 
control and antiemetics, which were transitioned to po form, and 
now which he does not need. Given that he didn't have adequate 
po intake for about 7 days, we placed an NJ tube and started 
tube feeds. He pulled this tube out, but was already tolerating 
full liquids, which was advanced to a regular low-fat diet 
successfully. 

2. Transaminitis: He had transaminitis likely related to his 
alcohol intake. These were trended down. We drew viral hepatitis 
serologies, still pending.

3. Hypertriglyceridemia: His triglycerides were 536 on 
admission.

4. EtOH use several days prior to this admission. He was 
monitored on a CIWA scale, and was not symptomatic. Social work 
was also consulted. He agrees that he should avoid alcohol and 
would even be amenable to abstaining from alcohol if told by his 
PCP.

___ w/ presumed familial hypertriglyceridemia, recurrent acute 
pancreatitis with known pancreatic pseudocyst, and DM, who 
presented with acute onset of abdominal pain and n/v. 

The patient has had about ten hospitalizations for pancreatitis 
since ___. His pancreatitis was attributed to his 
hypertriglyceridemia and his alcohol use.  Most recently, he was 
hospitalized in ___, where he required plasmapheresis for a 
triglyceride level of > 6500. Since then, he has been readmitted 
two times with abdominal pain and pancreatitis, has developed a 
pseudocyst, and has also been diagnosed with DM (which is 
possibly a result of his pancreatitis).

On the morning of presentation, he had recurrence of epigastric 
abdominal pain with associated nausea and NBNB emesis. These 
symptoms are similar to his prior presentations with 
pancreatitis.

In the ED, vitals were stable: 98.3, 78, 122/80, 18, 100% RA. 
Basic labs, including his LFTs and lipase, were unremarkable 
(although triglycerides were not checked). CT abdomen with 
contrast showed enlargement of his known pseudocyst from 2.4 to 
4 cm and inflammatory findings consistent with acute-on-chronic 
pancreatitis. He was given dilaudid, IV NS and was admitted to 
medicine.

#Acute pancreatitis
#Pancreatic necrosis
Abdominal pain and imaging findings c/w acute-on-chronic 
pancreatitis. Lipase is not elevated but with his recurrent 
pancreatitis and evidence of increasing pancreatic insufficiency 
this is not unexpected. He was kept NPO with IV fluids. The 
following day, the patient's pain improved. He was tolerating a 
regular diet without nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain prior to 
discharge. His triglycerides were checked and were 119 therefore 
it is unclear what triggered the patient's exacerbation.  For 
the patient's pancreatic necrosis, advanced endoscopy was 
consulted. They reviewed the images and felt that the pseudocyst 
did not warrant drainage at this time. The patient has

IMAGING RESULTS
==============
___ CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
LOWER CHEST: Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  The visualized lung 
fields are
otherwise unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pleural or 
pericardial
effusion.
 
ABDOMEN:
HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous hypoattenuation 
throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions.  There is no 
evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  
The gallbladder is within normal limits.
 
PANCREAS: The pancreas is enlarged and heterogeneous with 
substantial adjacent fat stranding and fluid collections in the 
pancreatic body, including a 2.8 x 2.0 cm fluid collection 
replacing the pancreatic body parenchyma which occupies less 
than 30% of the glandular volume (series 5, image 35).  
Additional scattered, poorly defined area of fluid located 
adjacent to the gastric body (series 6b, image 23) is noted.  
Previously noted fluid collection adjacent to the pancreatic 
tail has nearly resolved (series 6b, image 35).  There is marked 
attenuation of the junction of the superior mesenteric and 
portal veins (series 6b, image 33).  The splenic vein is not 
definitively identified, but multiple collaterals are seen.  The 
splenic vein previously appeared attenuated.  Scattered 
pancreatic calcifications reflect the sequela of prior 
pancreatitis.  No pancreatic ductal dilatation is present.
 
SPLEEN: Areas of hypodensity near the splenic hilum likely 
reflecting prior
infarction are less prominent compared to the prior examination. 
 No
splenomegaly.
 
ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size 
and shape.
 
URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with 
normal nephrogram. There is a 3.3 x 1.9 cm simple cyst arising 
from the interpolar left kidney. No suspicious renal lesion.  No 
hydronephrosis.  No perinephric abnormality. There is no 
perinephric abnormality.
 
GASTROINTESTINAL: A small fluid collection adjacent to the 
greater curvature of the stomach has resolved.  Additional 
ill-defined fluid adjacent to the stomach is new (series 5, 
image 35; series 6b, image 22).  Small bowel loops demonstrate 
normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  The 
colon and rectum are within normal limits.  The appendix is 
normal.
 
PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. 
 There is a small amount of free fluid the pelvis.
 
REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are 
normal.
 
LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric 
lymphadenopathy.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy.
VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  No significant
atherosclerotic disease is noted.
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture. 
SOFT TISSUES: A tiny umbilical hernia containing fat is noted.
 
IMPRESSION:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis involving less than 30% of the 
volume of the gland with 2 acute necrotic collections, the 
larger measuring 2.8 x 2.0 cm within the pancreatic.
2. Splenic vein appears chronically occluded with prominent 
collateralization noted.  There is marked attenuation at the 
confluence of the superior mesenteric and portal veins.  
Previously noted splenic infarcts are less apparent on the 
current exam.
3. Hepatic steatosis.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with multiple previous episodes of pancreatitis (hyperTG 
and EtOH) and recent admission in ___ for hyperTG-induced 
pancreatitis, and T2DM who presented with abdominal pain from 
necrotizing pancreatitis, likely complication of recent 
hypertriglyceride-induced pancreatitis in ___.

ACUTE ISSUES:
#Necrotizing pancreatitis: Patient with recent discharge for 
hypertriglyceride-induced pancreatitis (___) presents with 
epigastric abdominal pain distinct from his prior episodes of 
acute pancreatitis. CT abdomen demonstrates necrotizing 
pancreatitis, but lipase within normal limits (47), suggesting 
current presentation likely complication of recent acute 
pancreatitis. He was not given prophylactic antibiotics as he 
had no systemic signs/symptoms of infection without 
leukocytosis. On recommendations from Surgery, he was initially 
kept NPO with IV fluids and dilaudid for pain control, and 
slowly advanced to a low-fat diet. He continued taking his home 
gemfibrozil throughout. 

#Chronic Splenic vein thrombosis: Patient has no history of 
upper GI bleeds, though was noted on CT to have splenic vein 
occlusion likely from pancreatitis that can predispose to 
gastric varices. Per hepatology and surgery recs, EGD screening 
and/or anticoagulation not warranted at this time.

CHRONIC ISSUES:
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Patient found on last admission to 
have uncontrolled DM with A1c of 10.4% and was started on qHS 
lantus during last admission. HbA1c during this admission was 
9.0. Home metformin and lantus were held during this admission, 
and he was kept on a humalog insulin sliding scale. His 
fingerstick blood glucose levels remained within normal limits 
during admission.

#Alcohol use: Patient has a history of alcohol use but had no 
signs of withdrawal while inpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] He will follow up with Dr. ___ in early ___ for 
follow up of his necrotizing pancreatitis and follow up imaging.
[] HbA1c during admission noted to be 9.0; may need titration of 
insulin regimen as outpatient.
[] Noted to have chronic splenic vein occlusion on his CT on 
admission with collaterals. Discussed with pancreaticobiliary 
surgery team: no indication for EGD screening for gastric 
varices or anticoagulation for chronic occlusion.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: ___ yo male with HLD, prior pancreatitis ___ EtOH and/or
hypertriglyceridemia, presenting with worsening epigastric/LUQ
pain after eating secondary to recurrent pancreatitis. 

Pt has a history of hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis
secondary to this, and reports he has been admitted to the
hospital "5 times in the past ___ years" for episodes of
pancreatitis. He was in his USOH when ~3 weeks ago he cut back 
on
his Gemfibrozil intake d/t myalgias and stiffness in his legs. 
Pt
reports improvement in myalgias/stiffness after this. On ___
he ate a large fatty meal, and yesterday morning woke up with
nausea and abdominal pain c/w prior episodes of pancreatitis.
Pain is sharp, mid-left abdomen, radiating to the midback.
Associated with subjective chills, no fevers. Multiple episodes
of bland vomiting. He initially resisted coming into the 
hospital
but his sister (an NP) eventually convinced him to come in
earlier today. 

In the ED labs were consistent with acute pancreatitis (lipase
333). RUQUS showed no cholelithiasis and no evidence of
cholecystitis. He received IV morphine 4mg x2, 2L LR, and IV
Zofran 4mg x2. 

Pt does report having a hard time adhering to a low fat diet,
saying "it's hard to avoid burgers and pizza when all my friends
eat that stuff all the time". He has known hypertriglyceridemia
and reports levels in the 600 range while on a very low fat diet
and on Gemfibrozil. PCP has him on Gemfibrozil 600mg BID but as
noted above he cut back on the dosage a few weeks ago. He does
endorse occasional binge drinking episodes ("I drink up to 6
beers when I go out with friends") but does not note any
correlation between EtOH intake and pancreatitis. He does not
thinks he has a drinking problem, has never gone through EtOH
withdrawal in the past.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis
Type II Diabetes

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a condition called acute pancreatitis, 
due to elevated triglyceride levels in your blood. Your 
triglyceride level was >6500 on admission. You were treated with 
a therapy called Plasmapheresis to remove the triglycerides from 
your bloodstream. This was very effective, and following the 
treatment your triglyceride level was down to 431, and remained 
stable over the next few days in the 400-500mg range. You were 
restarted on Gemfibrozil with no adverse effects. 

You were also discovered to have diabetes, and we discussed 
starting insulin therapy. Please check your blood sugars twice 
daily (once when you wake up, and once before going to bed). 
Take 10 units of Lantus at night. If your evening blood sugar is 
100-150, take only 5 units of Lantus. If your evening blood 
sugar is <100, do not take your lantus that night. Please also 
take 500mg Metformin twice daily. As with your Lantus, skip your 
dose of Metformin if your blood sugar is <100 (you do not need 
to lower the dose of Metformin if your blood sugar is 100-150).

1. There has been interval removal of the pancreatic 
cystogastrostomy tube. 
There is slight re-accumulation of the known peripancreatic 
collection 
posterior to the antrum of the stomach.  An additional small 
peripancreatic 
collection abutting the greater curvature of the stomach may 
represent the 
previously seen collection which was more air-filled. 
2. The pancreas is of atrophic with minimal peripancreatic 
stranding, improved 
since the prior study.  No convincing evidence of acute 
pancreatitis by CT. 
3. Splenomegaly with linear hypodensities compatible with 
multiple thrombosed 
vessels versus chronic infarct. 

MICRO:
___ 5:20 pm URINE

                            **FINAL REPORT ___

   URINE CULTURE (Final ___:    < 10,000 CFU/mL. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx familial hyperTG c/b pancreatitis/pseudocyst and recent
advanced endoscopic procedures, known chronic splenic vein
thrombosis, who presents with abdominal pain admitted for
pancreatitis and inability to take PO.

ACUTE ISSUES:

#Abdominal pain:
Recent axial stent placement to drain pancreatic pseudocyst 
complicated by acute arterial UGIB s/p ___ embolization, Last EGD 
on ___, with stent removal. Pain
currently per patient consistent with both prior episodes of 
pancreatitis and with the pseudocyst. TriGly 100, lipase 
negative at 23 (repeat at 17). CT with some reaccumulation of 
fluid s/p stent removal, LFTs wnl. Etiology in the setting of a 
negative lipase with such CT findings either chronic 
pancreatitis or more likely pseudocyst re-accumulation with 
structural compression. ERCP team was consulted who reiewd the 
case and determined ineligibility for intervention given 
psuodocyst size not suffiecient for benefit to surpass risks 
given his prior bleeding complications. He was monitored for VS 
instability to fever spikes. He remained covered with 
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole antibiotic therapy, which will 
be extended to 2 weeks. He was advanced from clears to a regular 
diet. His pain and nausea were successfully managed with IV 
Dilaudid and Zofran PRN and did not require any pain medication 
on the day of discharge while tolerating a diet. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Hx of acute blood loss anemia
# Upper GI bleed: Presumed gastric artery source, s/p L gastric 
artery embolization by ___. Large dilution effect on all cell 
lines demonstrated ___ following large IVF quantity. Remained 
stable for remainder of hospitalization. 
# Familial hypertriglyceridemia: Continued home Fenofibrate
# NIDDM (possibly from pancreatic insufficiency): Held home
Metformin,
monitored sugars, ISS PRN if not NPO
#Chronic Pain: Held Gabapentin 400 mg currently 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Follow-up appointment: PCP, GI
-___ medication: antibiotic therapy course (cipro/flagyl) for 2 
weeks
-Pancreatitic pseudocyst: He will need follow-up in clinic and 
consideration for repeat CT scan for possible 
drainage/reaccumulation.
-Labs: Hgb 11.3, Cr 0.8 upon discharge. Please recheck cbc to 
monitor anemia at his next follow-up appointment.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.

Why was I in the hospital?
  - You were hospitalized because you presented with abdominal 
pain which may have been concerning for many different causes 
given your history of pancreatitis flares in addition to 
pseudocyst formation and gastrointestinal bleed.

What was done while I was in the hospital?
  - Pictures were taken that showed that you had a small 
increase in the size of your pancreas pseudocyst in the time 
interval since your drainage and last scan.
  - These pictures also did not show strong evidence to suggest 
that you were having an acute pancreatitis attack, which was 
also reflected by some of your lab markers, although these may 
be diminished in chronic pancreatitis states.
  - Your case was reviewed by the ___ pancreas team here who 
determined that your new pseudocyst size was incompatible with 
physical intervention and manipulation, especially since the 
risks may outweigh the benefit given you had a previous bleeding 
complication.
  - You were started on medications to help control your 
abdominal pains and the subsequent nausea which followed.

What should I do when I go home?
  - It is very important that you take your medications as 
prescribed.
  - Please go to your scheduled appointment with your primary 
doctor.
  - If you have any signs of bleeding through vomiting or bowel 
movement or sudden worsening abdominal pains, please tell your 
primary doctor or go to the emergency room.

Best wishes, 
  Your ___ team
