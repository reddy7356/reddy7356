Your pain has improved and you are now ready to return home to 
continue your recovery. We had several discussions about your

heating pads to help sooth your painful muscles and should 
continue to stretch. This kind of physical therapy with help 
with your recovery.

You should be taking scheduled doses of Tylenol, ___ mg three 
times daily. For mild pain, you should be taking Motrin and for 
more severe pain only, you should be taking the Oxycodone as 
prescribed. Your pain should improve day by day and thus, you

medications will have to be managed by your PCP. 

You have no activity restrictions from an injury standpoint but 
you should not be working or driving while you are requiring
