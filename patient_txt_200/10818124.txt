Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH CAD, AFIB, DM2, recent LLL PNA p/w hypotension.  
.  
# Hypotension: Resolved upon admission to the floor after fluids

metoprolol doses. His medications were held and progressively 
re-started. Patient was discharged on metoprolol 100 mg PO QID.
.  
# Relative hypoxia: Patient comfortable on room air upon arrival 
to the floor. Unclear etiology, but most likely due to 
hypotension and poor flow. 
.
# Pneumonia: Patient with community acquired pneumonia 2 weeks 
ago and now comes with alveolar infiltrates on chest x-ray, but 
asymptomatic. There is no fever, chills, rigors, cough, 
shortness of breath. He will need CXR follow up in ~4 weeks as 
outpatient to document clear lungs and rule out masses.
.  
# Chronic diastolic heart failure: Stable throughout 
hospitalizaiton.

admission. No signs or symptoms of bleeding.  
.  
# Atrial fibrillation: Not rate controlled adequately. 
Increasing one single agent to max: metoprolol 400 mg Daily (100 
QID). Can start diltiazem if not rate controlled.  
.  
# Coronary artery disease: No EKG changes, negative enzymes. 
Continued aspirin, plavix, statin.
.  
# Type 2 diabetes: On ISS.
.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service
 
Facility:
___
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
Atrial Flutter with hypotension

Secondary Diagnosis:
Alcohol abuse
Coronary artery disease
Diabetes Mellitus
Peripheral vascular disease
Diabetic neuropathy

 
Discharge Condition:
Stable, tolerating diet, stable blood pressure and heart rate 
controlled.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at the ___ for low blood pressure. You received 
fluids and your blood pressure improved. Your heart rate was 
slower than normal, which can be explained by the medications 
you are taking for your atrial flutter. You had serial ECGs and 
blood tests (cardiac enzymes) that ruled out the possibility of 
a heart attack. Your diltiazem was stopped and once your blood 
pressure was better your medications for your atrial Flutter 
were slowly increased.

If you keep drinking, most likely this episodes of rapid heart 
beats will be repeated and will only be controlled with very 
high doses of medications that can affect your blood pressure. 
We repeatedly encouraged you to quit drinking alcohol throughout 
the hospitalization. We kept you on a tight observation to make 
sure you did not withdraw.

You also had infiltrates in your lungs, which most likely are 
due to the pneumonia you had a couple of weeks ago. You will 
need a repeat chest x-ray in ~4 weeks to make sure everything 
cleared out.

Your medications were changed as follows:
Stop taking diltiazem.
Take metoprolol tartrate 100 mg four times daily. 
You should otherwise continue to take your medications as 
indicated.
 
Followup Instructions:

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with a past medical history of CAD, SVT, DM, CRC 
presents to the ED with lethargy, and found to have pneumonia, 
and possible early sepsis. 
.
# Hypotension, possible sepsis likely ___ 
consolidation/pneumonia seen on CXR. The patient was initially 
admitted to the MICU and treated with CTX, levofloxacin and 
flagyl for CAP and possible aspiration PNA. He was volume 
resuscitated with IVFs with improvement in his SBPs. Blood and 
urine cultures were drawn. Cultures had no growth prior to 
discharge.  His antibiotics were switched to Levofloxacin and 
Flagyl prior to discharge to complete a ___s he was 
no longer febrile or hypotensive.
.
# UTI: Patient was found to have a e-coli UTI not sensitive to 
Cipro and only mildly sensitive to Macrobid (which he has been 
on for prophylaxis).  For this reason, he was discharged on 7 
days of Ampicillin for a complicated UTI and Macrobid was 
stopped as this may be breading resistance.
.
# EtOh abuse: No history of DTs or seizures. Started on a CIWA 
but did not require any benzodiazepines.  Previous hospice nurse 
and PCP corroborated with history of heavy alcohol use.
.
# CAD: Plavix and asa were continued and CEs were negative 
.
# SVT: The patient is not anticoagulated. His digoxin was 
continued. His metoprolol was held in the setting of initial 
hypotension and then restarted.
.
# DM2: Glucose managed with Lantus and ISS. Neurontin was 
continued. 
.
# Exam and imaging c/w COPD: Long smoking history and exam c/w 
COPD although no documented diagnosis. Albuterol and ipratropium 
nebs were used. The patient should have outpatient spirometry. 
.
# Poor po intake: Albumin less than 3. INR 1.3. Nutrition 
consult was done as was speech and swallow consult.  Patient 
elected for aspiration diet.
.
# Code Status/Goals of care: DNR/DNI (confirmed with patient).  
Patient elected for ICU level of care with intravenous 
antibiotics and rehabilitation, which seemed counter to his 
hospice level of care.  Discussed with PCP, ___ 
explained that patient is on hospice due to physical decline 
secondary to diabetic neuropathy and alcoholic myopathy.  He was 
in agreement that patient could remove himself from hospice 
services (which he has been on for approx ___ year) and go to 
rehab if that was within his personal goals.  Patient elected to 
go home with ___ services, however discharged with ___ services 
as hospice did not feel that he was an appropriate candidate any 
longer.

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ y.o male with h.o afib, ETOH abuse, CAD, DM, s/p 
___ cancer, recently admitted for afib RVR, who presents to 
the ED today with "fibrillations". Pt stated he was at home in 
his USOH when his HCP found that he was in "fibrillations" and 
called EMS. Reportedly, HCP found BP in 60's, EMS found SBP in 
the 90's, HR reportedly "sinus". Pt states he is never 
symptomatic from afib, including LH/dizziness/palp/CP, 
n/diaphoresis.  
.  
In the ED, Pt in sinus intil IV placed, then pt went into afib 
with RVR to the 140's. Pt rate controlled with 5mg IV lopressor, 
SBP then to 80's for which pt was given 4L IVF (also b/c lactate 
2.4). Pt given a total of 20mg IV dilt, then placed on a dilt 
gtt b/c "the IV dilt lowered the heart rate". Pt given calcium 
gluconate so the "dilt wouldn't lower the BP too much". Pt also 
got a dose of levoflox for unclear reasons. K was repleted.  
Last set of vitals. afeb, BP 107/58, hR 76, RR 15 sat 100% on

TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. 
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other

# Afib with RVR
Pt with history of atrial tachycardia s/p ablation in ___ with 
frequent breakthrough tachycardia. Pt present with "afib with 
RVR" in ED s/p IV lopressor, IV dilt, sent up on diltiazem drip. 
On morning of admission, patient was tachycardic to the 160s 
despite a maximal diltiazem drip. He denied denied chest pain, 
palpitations, shortness of breath, pre-syncope EKG at that time 
was found to be atrial tachycardia. After several doses of IV 
lopressor, the patient spontaneously converted to a sinus rhythm 
with rate around 70. The diltiazem drip was discontinue and the 
patient was manage on Toprol-XL in the morning and diltiazem 30 
mg PO four times daily. He remained in sinus rhythm until the 
morning of ___, when he again returned to an atrial 
fibrillation with rate to the 160s while patient was still 
sleeping. Was woken and again denied chest pain, palpitations,

___ year old man with CAD, type 2 DM, wheelchair bound from 
polyneuropathy ___ DM and alcohol, and history of Afib/flutter 
after ablation presents with hypotension.

1. Afib/flutter: He had ablation once in ___ but had 
recurrences of afib/flutter thereafter. He is completely 
asymptomatic despite episodes of hypotension and or rapid 
ventricular rate because of paroxysmal Afib/flutter. Over last 
few months, he has been tried on several combinations of 
diltiazem and metoprolol. Most recent admission was for 
hypotension as well. He was on diltiazem 240 mg QD and 
Metoprolol 100 mg BID (increased prior to that ___ afib with 
rapid ventricular rate). During that admission, he was switched 
to only metoprolol 100 mg QID. During this admission, we 
decreased metoprolol to 100 mg TID and added Digoxin. We 
consulted the EP service and contacted his cardiologist. Despite 
frequent episodes of Afib/flutter with HR of 120, he was 
completely asymptomatic. He will be discharge on both Digoxin 
and metoprolol to 100 mg TID. The latter will be decreased to 
100 mg BID on ___. This will allow Digoxin to work prior to 
reducing the dose of Metoprolol. Metoprolol can be further 
weaned off by his PCP/Cardiologist. Per EP recommendations 
Digoxin level should be check post discharge and dose be 
adjusted accordingly. He was not on Coumadin because of 
continued alcohol use and H/O CNS Hemorrhage. On the floor, he 
had no evidence of altered mental status. His head CT was 
negative. His UA/CXR/WBC were also negative. He had no evidence 
of infection. His continued alcohol drinking can trigger his 
arrhythmia. We will arrange a close follow up with 
PCP/Cardiologist for the above adjustments ( ___ with 
his cardiologist).

2. Lactic acidosis - likely ___ ischemia from hypotension. This 
resolved with Fluids. He was given Vanc/Ceftaz in ED for lactic 
acidosis; however, he is afebrile, oriented, with negative 
UA/CXR and no symptoms of infection.

3. Hypotension - Likely ___ high doses of metoprolol and/or 
paroxysmal Afib with RVR despite taking metoprolol. 

4. Iron deficiency anemia: The iron deficiency noted on labs on 
___ with ferritin of 18. We advised out-patient colonoscopy 
given HX of colon cancer. He had none for the last ___ years.

5. Alcohol use/abuse: This concern was raised before by other 
providers. Per patient and caregiver, he has cut down on 
drinking but not interested in quitting altogether. He does not 
want to quit smoking too.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man with multiple medical problems, including paryxosmal 
atrial fibrillation, not on anticoagulation because of ETOH 
abuse and frequent falls, hx subdural hematoma, presented with a 
near fall and failure to thrive. His care-taker stated that he 
was unable to care for him any more.   
.  
# Hyponatremia - Per history and exam, the patient appeared 
clinically hypovolemic. Na on admission was 125, and a 
calculated FeNa was 0.4%. Patient was hydrated with 1L NS via 
Banana bag overnight, and then PO intake was encouraged without 
difficulty. Repeat Na showed a return toward baseline (133.) 
Patient will need to follow-up with his PCP ___ 1 week to 
re-check his Na level.
.  
# Failure to thrive - per history, the patient has had a history 
of weight loss for more than ___ years. After reviewing OMR notes, 
the patient appears to be at his baseline functional status. 
Patient was assessed by Physical/Occupational therapy and 
recommended a home safety evaluation, which patient refused. 
Patient was also seen by the Addictions specialist, who 
confirmed patient's continued refusal to consider rehab. 
.  
# CAD - Pt has had a history of multiple myocardial infarctions. 
However, pt has had no chest pain, diaphoresis, shortness of 
breath, or any other systems consistent with an ischemic event.  
Pt was continued on his home doses of ASA, Clopidogrel, Toprol 
XL, and Atorvastatin.
.  
# Hx of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia: 
Recent holter prior to admission confirms PAF and predominant 
sinus arrhythmia/atrial tachycardia, but pt has been 
asymptomatic throughout his stay. He was not on Warfarin at 
admission secondary to his history of subdural hematoma, falls, 
and ETOH abuse. Toprol XL was continued for rate control, and pt 
was monitored on telemetry.  
.  
# ETOH abuse: Pt was admitted in an intoxicated state. Only ETOH 
was positive on serum toxicology and urine screen. Pt denied a 
history of withdrawal, and did not exhibit any signs/symptoms of 
withdrawal during his stay. No valium was required, and CIWAS 
have remained negative. Pt was given 1L NS via banana bag, and 
started on PO Thiamine/Folate/Multivitamin afterwards. The 
Addictions specialist confirmed patient's refusal to pursue 
alcohol cessation/rehab, and was familiar with the patient's 
case from prior admissions.  The pt was encouraged to consider 
ETOH cessation, and will need to follow up further with his PCP.
.  
# DM - Pt has a long history of diabetes mellitus with 
neuropathy in his extremities. He attributes his progressive 
inability to transfer to the neuropathy in his lower 
extremities. He did not know his insulin dose, and was placed 
for the time being on Humalog insulin sliding scale. He was 
placed on qid finger sticks, and was maintained on a 
diabetic/heart healthy diet. His blood sugar levels remained 
stable and within normal limits during his stay. He will need to 
follow-up with his PCP to monitor his diabetes and neuropathy.
.  
# Depression: the patient was stable during admission. He was 
continued on his home Wellbutrin.

.  
ECHO: ___: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular 
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function are normal (LVEF >55%) Transmitral Doppler and tissue 
velocity imaging are consistent with normal LV diastolic 
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally 
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.  
.  
CXR ___: my read. Large lung volumes, lungs clear.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with hx of PAF presents with atrial fibrillation with 
RVR, admitted for rate control.    
.  
# CAD: The patient has a past history of multipe MI's.  While 
admitted he had no chest pain and his EKG was without signs of 
ischemia.  
.
# Rhythm: The patient presented with an irregular narrow complex 
tachycardia. While admitted his HR varied between the 50's to 
the 150's.  While he was in atrial fibrillation, his HR was 
greatly elevated and once he broke out of atrial fibrillation, 
he had multiple early atrial beats with different p-wave 
morphologies, likely a wandering atrial pacemaker.  During the 
morning he cycled several times between WAP and atrial 
fibrillation, but once we increased his metoprolol dose to 75 
tid, he mostly remained in WAP.
.
The patient has a history of atrial tachycardia, s/p ablation in 
___ which has failed and he has had breakthrough tachycardia / 
flutter which is paroxysmal.  He was on toprol 100mg daily at 
home, so we increased his metoprolol dose while admitted to rate 
control him.  He was being controlled with 75 mg metoprolol tid, 
so we discharged him on 200 mg Toprol.  While admitted, his BP 
remained stable, even #when his HR increased to the 150's. As 
his Mg was 1.7, we repleted him with 4g PO.  We also sent a TSH 
which came back normal at 1.4.  He also had an echo from ___ 
which was essentially normal, including normal LA size.  We 
discharged him with the increased dose of metoprolol, a Holter 
monitor to monitor him for the first 24 hours post discharge on 
the new dose, and we made him a follow up appointment with Dr. 
___.
.  
# DM: While admitted we kept him on SSI with qid finger sticks 
since he couldn't remember which type of insulin he takes at 
home. 
.
# Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures where under good 
control while admitted.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: We continued the patient's atorvastatin.
.  
# ETOH abuse: Patient has no history of withdrawal and was at 
low risk given negative serum ETOH screen. As the patient has a 
history of moderate alcohol intake we put him on thiamine, 
folate, and a multivitamin.  He had no signs of withdrawal 
during his stay.

Imagings
CXR (___): Markedly limited study. There is suggestion of a 
dense 
consolidation of the left lower and mid lung zones. This may 
represent 
pneumonia. If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views 
in the 
radiology suite for better characterization. 

CT Head (___): 
1. Prominent ventricles, ___ represent normal 
pressure 
hydrocephalus in the appropriate clinical setting. Clinical 
correlation 
recommended. 
2. No other acute intracranial process identified. 

TTE (___): Mild symmetric LVH with normal regional and 
global biventricular systolic function. Moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

CXR (___): Worsening right upper lobe and left mid and 
lower lung opacities, consistent with worsening pneumonia. 

CXR (___): As compared to the previous radiograph, there is 
minimal
improvement of the pre-existing mainly perihilar and left 
lateral parenchymal opacities. The extent of the retrocardiac 
atelectasis, potentially combined with a small pleural effusion, 
is unchanged.  On the right, the parenchymal opacities have 
apparently decreased in extent.  No evidence of newly appeared 
parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette. 
Unchanged position of the endotracheal tube and the nasogastric 
tube.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with coronary artery disease s/p PCI, atrial 
tachycardia s/p failed ablation, diabetes mellitus type II 
complicated by neuropathy leading to spinal cord atrophy who 
presented to the ED with lethargy x ___ days and was found to be 
hypoxic with presumed multifocal PNA and atrial 
fibrillation/tachycardia with RVR.

# Hypotension, resolved: BP on arrival to ICU was 70/50 in the 
setting of likely multifocal pneumonia seen on CXR and volume 
depletion in the setting of poor oral intake.  Bedside echo 
showing hyperdynamic ventricles and respiratory variation in IVC 
filling pressures on admission consitent with hypovolemia.  He 
was aggressively fluid resuscitated by early goal directed 
protocol with MAP > 65. He was started on Levaquin for community 
acquired pneumonia and cefepime for Gram negative coverage in 
setting of chronic aspiration.  He was ruled out for ACS with 
three sets of enzymes.  Random and am cortisol showed 
appropriate adrenal function.  His hypotension resolved with 
fluid resuscitation and never needed pressors.  He was 
normotensive off medications.  

# Hypoxia, resolved: Persistent hypoxia to mid-80s on RA in the 
ED, likely ___ underlying multifocal PNA which is visualized on 
CXR.  Hx of recurrent PNA suggestive of repeat aspiration 
events.  Alternatively, patient with risk factors, peripheral 
neuropathy and multiple bacterial infections is also at risk of 
HIV which was sent.  He was started on levaquin for CAP and 
cefepime for gram negative coverage in setting of chronic 
aspiration.  Pt improved and was called out to the floor on ___. 
 On the floor he maintained his blood pressure and heart rate 
but required continued oxygen with saturations in the low to mid 
90's on 3L NC. On ___, he triggered for mental status changes 
with orientation to self.  He had significant rhonchi on exam at 
that time and respiratory was called; deep suction removed large 
amounts of mucous which were sent for culture. Later that 
evening, the patient was noted to have worsnening oxygen 
requirement with 93% oxygen on 5 liters and 97% on a 
nonrebreather.  Deep suction was attempted but the patient had 
desaturation in this context.  Received zydis 2.5 mg for 
agitation and paranoia. ABG ___. Transferred back to MICU 
for respiratory evaluation. On ___, he continued to require deep 
suctioning for large amount of secretions.  He continued to get 
chest physical therapy with deep suctioning for large amount of 
secretions on ___ as well.  On ___, he was noted to have 
increased requirement in his ___ mask from 50% to 100% with 
whiteout of left lung bases concerning for mucous plug.  He was 
intubated for respiratory distress on ___.  He was 
extubated on ___ when goals of care were changed to comfort 
measures only (see below). Since then, he has been on minimal 
oxygen and morphine intermittently for comfort and maintaining 
O2 saturation in mid 90% on RA.

# Leukocytosis: His WBC increased on ___ and continued to rise 
on ___.  He was started on vancomycin/flagyl while levaquin 
and cefepime were continued as he was clinically getting worse.  
IV Vancomycin/flagyl/levaquin and cefepime were discontinued on 
___ when he was made CMO

# Delirium.  Resolving.  He was noted to be agitated and 
paranoid while being transferred back to the MICU.  Likely 
secondary to hypoxia, improved with deep suctioning and 
respirator stabilization.  His agitation has been managed by 
olanzepine rapid disintegrating tab.  He has not had episodes of 
agitation since being on olanzepine.  Upon discharge, he is 
oriented to person, place, and time.

# Atrial fibrillation with RVR: on initial arrival to ICU, HR in 
150-160s and irregular.  Underlying process of pneumonia is 
likely the driving force for it.  Patient was on anticoagulation 
alone with aspirin and plavix given history of multiple falls.  
He was started on amiodarone and over the next few days was 
weaned off metoprolol and digoxin. TTE was performed which 
showed LVH and no clots. Amiodarone IV changed to PO on ___, 
and then changed to home metoprolol. He remained stable in AFib 
without RVR.  He was noted to have RVR on ___ and was 
restarted on amiodarone while metoprolol was discontinued.  On 
___, he continued to be in RVR with rates in 120s so 
metoprolol was added for rate control with amiodarone.  However, 
because he was made CMO, his AFib medications were discontinued. 
 His HR has been mostly < 100 per minute off of medications.  

# Truncal ataxia: per ED evaluation, patient persistently 
leaning towards left.  CT head was negative.  Per neurology, 
there was no acute process.

# H/o CAD: He denied angina.  EKG was without acute ST changes. 
Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3.  Initially, he was continued 
on aspirin, Plavix, and metoprolol as mentioned above.  However, 
after he was made CMO, these medications were held. 

# H/o ETOH abuse.  There was no h/o withdrawal seizures.  He did 
not have evidence of active withdrawal while in the hospital.

# Type II DM: No evidence of DKA by labs.  Patient was managed 
by insulin sliding scale.  However, with CMO status, finger 
stick and insulin administration were held.

# Malnutrition: Albumin of 2.1.  Per speech and swallow, NPO 
with crushed meds in apple sauce with concern for chronic 
aspiration and will need to be reevaluted once off of face mask 
for oxygen.  NG tube placed on ___ and tube feeds started 
with nutritions help.  Tube feeds held on ___ in the setting of 
desaturation and copious secretions, due to concern for 
aspiration.  Restarted ___ as it seemed that secretions were 
mucous and not gastric contents.  However, with CMO status, 
patient resumed regular diet per his preference and nutritional 
supplement was added.

# Left buttock ulcer.  1 cm x 1 cm.  Area does not appear to be 
infected.  This should continue to be monitored with regular 
repositioning every 2 hours and daily wound care.

# Comfort measures only: On ___ after extensive discussion 
with his health care proxy, it was decided to make the patient 
comfort measures only and was extubated on ___.  
Antibiotics were discontinued.  He was transitioned to narcotics 
as needed for shortness of breath and pain.  He was discharged 
on oral morphine solution as his Foley catheter and PICC were 
removed on ___ and ___ respectively.  He will be 
followed by hospice.  It will be important to continue the 
discussion of Do Not Hospitalize with patient and his health 
care proxy.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure to take care of you at ___ 
___.

You were admitted to the hospital for pneumonia and fast 
irregular heart rate.  You were treated with antibiotics for the 
pneumonia as well as medications to help controlling your heart. 
 

Because of your worsening breathing, you were on a ventilator (a 
machine that help to breath for you) for a short period of time. 
 After a discussion between your health care proxy and your 
intensive care team, it was decided that you would prefer to 
live with dignity and would prefer not to have invasive 
procedures done such as a PEG tube (feeding tube) or a 
tracheostomy (more permanent breathing tube).  You did very well 
after they remove the ventilator and required minimal oxygen.

The medical team discussed with you about hospice.  You and your 
health care proxy both decided that you want to ultimately be 
home with hospice.  Hospice nurse and social workers came and 
explored with you regarding your options and necessary support 
that you may need.  While resources at home get set up, it is 
thought that you can go to inpatient hospice for a period of 
time.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of CAD, s/p 
stenting, paroxysmal atrial flutter, DM2, and PVD, recently 
admitted for failure to thrive, who was brought to the ED for 
hypotension and tachycardia, and found to have a UTI.
   
#. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient's UA was suggestive of a 
UTI, likely related to an indwelling foley placed because of 
urinary retension on the patient's prior admission.  Based on 
history from the patient, it likely became infected at home.  
Foley catheter was removed when the patient arrived on the 
floor.  He was empirically treated with ciprofloxacin with a 
plan for a 7 day course of therapy.  
  
#. Atrial flutter with RVR: The patient's tachycardia and 
hypotension at home was most likely the result of atrial flutter 
with RVR.  He was reported given his usual metoprolol dose 
without resolution of the tachycardia, but he was normotensive 
on arrival to the ED.  The patient was monitored on telemetry 
and triggered on the floor the morning following admission for 
another episode of RVR that resolved within an hour of his 
receiving metoprolol.  The patient is usually assymptomatic with 
these episodes, but did report feeling palpitations with his 
morning episode in the hospital.  The patient's cardiologist, 
Dr. ___ was contacted and the patient's regimen was 
discussed.  He advised not changing the patient's digoxin and 
metoprolol regimen at this time.  If the patient develops atrial 
flutter at home, he should take his metoprolol early and if his 
heart rate does not decrease within an hour of taking the 
medication, or if he becomes markedly symptomatic, he should 
come to the ED.
   
#. Urinary retention: The patient was started on tamsulosin for 
urinary retention.  The foley catheter was removed and he 
successfully voided.  He was advised to keep his urology 
___ appointment so that they could determine whether he 
needs to continue taking this medication and to further evaluate 
the patient for hematuria which was noted during his prior 
hospitalization.  The patient was also given medications to 
prevent constipation as he had been constipated prior to 
entering the hospital and constipation can exacerbate urinary 
retention.  
      
#. Dementia: The patient likely has some underlying dementia 
given his inability to remember extensive discussions regarding 
the foley catheter on his prior admission.  Work-up on last 
admission showed atrophy of medulla and upper cervical spine, 
thought to be secondary to chronic alcohol use.  He has 
behavioral neurology ___ as an outpatient in ___.
    
#. Depression: The patient appeared notably depressed the 
morning following admission.  It was unclear to what extent this 
was triggered by poor sleep the night before versus being an 
ongoing problem for this gentleman.  Of note, his duloxetine was 
stopped on his previous admission as it may have contributed to 
his hyponatremia.  His PCP may wish to consider starting the 
patient on mirtazepine or another medication that is both an 
anti-depressant and appetite stimulant.
   
#. Left foot fractures: The patient was found to have ___ 
through ___ metatarsal fractures on his prior admission.  His 
caregiver reported an incident at home in which the patient had 
tried to walk.  The patient was reminded not to place weight on 
his foot to allow it to heal.  He was continued on calcium and 
vitamin D supplementation. 
  
#. Diabetes, type 2: The patient's blood sugar was elevated on 
admission.  This may be due to increased PO intake.  Glargine 
was left at prior home dose due to concern for hypoglycemia at 
home.  He was given a diabetic diet.
    
#. Anemia: Labs during the patient's prior hospitalizations 
suggested that this was related to iron deficiency.  B12 and 
folate were normal.  The patient was continued on iron sulfate 
BID and given a bowel regimen to help prevent constipation.
  
#. Coronary artery disease: Stable. The patient had non-flow 
limiting 3VD on cath in ___.  He was ___ on this admission.  
He was continued on aspirin, atorvastatin, plavix, and 
metoprolol.
    
#. History of hyponatremia: Notably, the patient's sodium level 
was normal on this admission.
  
#. Neuropathy: The patient was continued on gabapentin.  
  
FEN: Cardiac, diabetic diet, honey thickened liquids, sugar free 
shakes TID with meals; folic acid, B-vitamin, multivitamin 
supplements
  
DISPOSITION: Home.  This was discussed at length with the 
patient and his caregiver.  The patient emphatically desired to 
return to home.  As it was only a vital sign abnormality due to 
ongoing atrial flutter with RVR that brought him into the 
hospital, and not further failure to thrive, it was decided to 
honor his wishes.

.
CXR (___): Compared to the prior study there is improved 
aeration in the left lower lobe but there continues to be a 
small patchy area of increased hazy opacity that could represent 
an area of atelectasis versus a very early infiltrate. This has 
an improved appearance compared to the earlier study. A small 
area of scarring versus atelectasis is seen in the left apex. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Pt is a ___ year old man with a history of multiple medical 
problems including a variety of superventricular tachycardias 
including afib/flutter as well as atrial tach, s/p ablation in 
___ and diabetes; as well as alcohol abuse; who presents after 
a fall with known mechanism with afib, RVR and hypotension in 
the field, as well as a lactate of 3.0 and an ambiguous opacity 
on CXR.  
.  
1) Tachycardia: On transfer to this hospital and in the ED, 
patient was in A fib with RVR with rates in the 140s on arrival. 
A total of 15 mg of IV diltiazem was given in the ED, with quick 
return to sinus rhythm and HR 70'-80s. During his admisison, 
telemetry showed predominantly a sinus rhythm with HR 60-80's, 
with some intermittent irregularity.  He had one self-limited 
episode of tachycardia to the 140s prior to getting his morning 
BB dose.  The resolved spontaneously and he remained stable 
throughout.  Etiology of original episode was felt to be likely 
ETOH & dehydration.  There was no evidence of infection on CXR 
and blood cx were NGTD.  
.  
2) Hypotension: On tranfer to this hospital and in the ED, 
patient had a systolic BP in the 60's. This was felt to be in 
the setting of RVR and poor forward flow.  He repsonded rapidly 
to fluid resusictation and conversion to NSR. Lactate in the ED 
was elevated to 3.0 which was concerning for infection, however 
there were no focal signs of infection. WBC was 6.6, UA 
negative, CXR x2 was negative.  CXR in the ED was read as 
concern for pneumonia and he received 750mg IV Levo.  On the 
floor his exam was not consistent with pneumonia and antibiotics 
were discontinued. He remained afebrile throughout his stay.  
.  
3) CAD: We continued his home meds: lip___ 40 ___, metoprolol 50 
PO bid, plavix 75 ___ 325 ___.  He was ruled out for MI by 
serial CE which were all negative.
.
4) Alcohol abuse: BAL on arrival >200. Patient was maintained on 
the CIWA scale, but no benzodiazapine were required as CIWA were 
always <10 and there was no other evidence of withdrawal. 
Alcohol cessation was discussed.  He was maintained on thiamine, 
folate while in the hospital.
. 
5) Endocrine: Patient has a long history of diabetes. Had some 
borderline low FSBG (54) when he first arrived on the floor.  
This responded to PO intake and they remained stable thereafter. 
 He was continued on his home regimen of novolog mix 70/30 and 
sliding scale.
.    
6)Psych: Home SSRI (duloxetine 30 mg ___ was continued without 
issues.
.
7)Disposition: Patient was seen by physical therapy who 
concluded that a likely cause of his repeated falls is the 
inability of his wheelchair to transverse his bathroom door 
requiring him to take several steps to the toilet. A new 
wheelchair with removable arms was given to the patient while in 
house. This should allow him to enter his bathroom, and transfer 
from the chair directly to the toilet.

vomiting, SOB, cough or CP. He denied decreased PO intake.  
  
Of note, the patient has had recurrent hyponatremia over the 
last month with Na ranging 120-125 during this time. He was 
admitted to ___ from ___ for hyponatremia and Na was 122 
at that time. It was attributed to both hypovolemia and his 
lasix. He was given IVF and lasix was held and Na improved to 
125. He was sent home on ___. dose of lasix of 20mg every other 
day. He was then seen in cardiology clinic on ___ and Na was 
again low at 120 and lasix was stopped.  
 
In the ED initial vitals were T 97.4 BP 151/77 HR 76 RR 18 98% 
RA. CXR was performed and showed no acute process. He was given 
2 units regular insulin for ___ 263. He received 1L NS. Labs 
remarkable for Na 123. On arrival to the floor, the patient was 
questioning why he is here. He denies any pain, cough, SOB.

Studies:
___ Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial premature beats versus 
wandering atrial pacemaker. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave 
abnormalities. Low voltage in the limb leads. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ atrial premature beats are more 
frequent. Clinical correlation and repeat tracing are suggested. 

  
___ CXR PA & LAT - FINDINGS: 
The lungs are over-inflated, suggesting COAD. The 
cardiomediastinal 
silhouette is stable. There is no focal pulmonary consolidation. 

CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. 
    
___ MRI HEAD without contrast - FINDINGS: There is no 
evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or recent 
infarction. There is extensive periventricular white matter 
hyperintensity on the FLAIR images. The significance of this is 
uncertain.  It is often attributed to chronic small vessel 
ischemia. The most striking observation is profound atrophy of 
the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord. Views of the spinal 
cord are limited to motion degraded images on the sagittal 
views. However, this suggests it may be worthwhile to perform MR 
imaging of the cervical spine. There have been no significant 
changes since the head CT of ___. There is no evidence 
of hydrocephalus.   
There is a tiny focus of hypointensity on the gradient-echo 
images in the 
right cerebral peduncle that may represent an area of old 
hemorrhage. 
CONCLUSION: No evidence of hydrocephalus, recent infarction, or 
hemorrhage.   
Striking atrophy of the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord. 
   
___ Foot AP, Lat, obl x-ray - IMPRESSION: 
1. Fractures of the distal left second, third, and fourth 
metatarsals, which are of indeterminate acuity, ? subacute. 
2. Old healed distal fibular fracture seen at periphery of film. 
See comment. 
3. Severe osteopenia, which limits detection for fractures. 
Allowing for 
this, no other fractures and no dislocation detected.  
  
___ Atrial flutter suggested but may be "coarse" atrial 
fibrillation
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes Since previous tracing of 
the same date, probably no significant change.
  
___ Probable atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response
Modest nonspecific ST-T wave changes. Since previous tracing of 
___, tachyarrhythmia now present.
  
___ Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. 
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific 
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ 
the atrial fibrillation is absent and sinus rhythm and premature 
atrial contractions are now present.
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with a history of CAD, DM, 
aflutter, PVD, EtOH use who presented with decreased PO intake, 
lethargy, and unusual hoarding behavior.  
   
#. Failure to thrive / Depression / Dementia: The patient has 
had a progressive decline with a recent increase in the rate per 
Dr. ___ knows the patient well.  Geriatrics/geripsych was 
consulted to assist with evaluating the patient.  TSH, B12, and 
folate normal were normal. RPR was negative.  HIV test was 
negative.  MRI head showed prominent atrophy of the medulla and 
upper cervical cord.  Neurology was consulted to comment on 
these findings and to evaluate the patient.  They felt the MRI 
findings were related to chronic alcohol use.  Occult malignancy 
was also considered within the differential.  Chest x-ray showed 
no evidence of tumors.  CEA was checked based on the patient's 
history of colon cancer and was also negative.  The patient had 
poor PO intake in the hospital based on nutrition service 
calorie counts.  The medical team spoke with the patient and his 
caregiver at length regarding the importance of sufficient PO 
intake for both calories and to prevent dehydration.  The team 
also stressed the importance of avoiding alcohol.  Ultimately, 
the patient insisted that he wanted to return home instead of 
going to rehab.  Per neurology recommendation, outpatient 
behavioral neurology follow-up was sceduled.  The patient should 
undergo routine age-appropriate cancer screening as an 
outpatient.  Assistance at home with multiple caregivers, 
including ___, OT, & ___ was arranged.  The patient's recently 
started duloxetine was held in the hospital as explained below.  
If anti-depressant therapy is warranted for this patient in the 
future, consideration should be given to using agents other than 
SSRIs or SNRIs that can induce hyponatremia.  Mirtazepine may be 
an option to consider, particularly given its appetite 
stimulating side-effect.  
    
#. Hyponatremia: Hyponatremia has been an ongoing problem for 
the patient over the past month.  His sodium was 123 on 
admission, and improved to 128 with normal saline fluid 
resuscitation (the patient was dehydrated on admission as well). 
 The etiology for his hyponatremia is not entirely clear.  He 
had not been on lasix.  His TSH was normal.  He does not have a 
history of CHF or liver diseas.  He had a PPD placed that was 
also negative and an appropriate cortisol stimulation response.  
His urine osm was > 600 on admission, suggesting he may have 
SIADH.  As mentioned above, no evidence of malignancy was found 
and age-appropriate cancer screening is recommended as an 
outpatient.  The patient's sodium eventually normalized to 135 
on the day of discharge despite receiving no further IV fluids.  
It is hypothesized that his sodium normalized as a result of 
some combination of increased PO intake in the hospital, absence 
of alcohol intake in the hospital ("beer potomania?") and 
cessation of duloxetine (an SNRI) which can induce hyponatremia. 
 
    
#. Urinary retention: The patient was unable to urinate after 
foley removal with PVRs in the 300-600+ range.  It was unclear 
if his urinary retention was chronic or acute and whether it is 
related to neurological issues vs. BPH. vs. other.  Prostate was 
not markedly enlarged on exam, though foley was difficult to 
place per nursing.  The patient was discharged home with a foley 
and scheduled with outpatient urology follow-up for a voiding 
trial and consideration of medications if appropriate.  
   
#. Hematuria: A small number of red blood cells were noted on 
the patient's inital urine analysis that was likely obtained 
after foley placement in the ED.  The patient could not void on 
his own after foley removal, so a second foley was eventually 
placed after several straight caths.  A second UA obtained on 
discharge almomst 48 hours after the second foley was placed 
continued to show hematuria, in fact, worse that what was seen 
on the initial UA.  Given his smoking history, the patient needs 
further evaluation to determine whether hematuria is secondary 
to traumatic foley placement vs. bladder tumor.
   
#. Left foot fractures: The patient was noted to have 
circumferential ecchymoses on his left big toe on admission.  
Foot x-ray was obtained and showed multiple fractures ___ 
through ___ metatarsals).  Podiatry was consulted and 
recommended that the patient be non-weight bearing on his left 
foot and be be given a special shoe.  They also trimmed the 
patient's toe nails.  The patient was continued on calcium and 
vitamin D and home ___ was arranged for the patient as well as 
podiatry follow-up after discharge.
   
#. Atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR: The patient had nearly 
daily episodes of rapid ventricular rate, often occuring near 
the time of medication administration, but not always.  He 
occasionally required additional PO and IV metoprolol to 
normalize his rate.  He is not on coumadin due to his fall risk. 
 He was continued on digoxin and toward the end of his hospital 
stay his metoprolol was changed from 100mg bid to 75 mg TID to 
try to minimize RVR episodes.
    
#. Diabetes, type 2: The patient's ___ were elevated with 
improved PO intake in the hospital.  Per the patient's friend 
and caretaker his BS have been better controlled at home.  This 
difference seems to be related to both the quantity and type of 
foods being eaten.  The patient's basal rate of glargin 6 units 
QAM was not changed because of concern for hypoglycemia at home 
if the patient's PO intake decreases again on discharge.  He was 
advised to follow-up with his ___ provider.  He was 
given a diabetic diet while in house.
  
#. Anemia: Labs during the patient's prior hospitalization 
suggested that this was related to iron deficiency.  B12 and 
folate were normal.  The patient's iron supplementation was 
doubled.  
  
#. Coronary artery disease: The patient had non-flow limiting 
3VD on cath in ___.  He was continued on aspirin, his statin, 
plavix, and metoprolol.
   
# Alcohol abuse: The patient was placed on a CIWA scale while 
hospitalized, but benzodiazepines were not needed as there was 
no evidence of withdrawal.  He was continued on B-vitamins and a 
multivitamin.  Alcohol intake was discussed at length with the 
patient and his caretaker by multiple members of the medical 
team.  
   
#. Neuropathy: The patient was continued on gabapentin.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for evaluation of dehydration 
and deconditioning.  You were given IV fluids and had multiple 
tests.  You had an MRI scan that showed some atrophy in an area 
of your brain known as the medulla.  This finding is likely 
related to long-term alcohol intake.  You are advised to stop 
drinking alcohol to prevent further damage to your brain.  In 
addition, we recommend that you follow-up with the behavioral 
neurologists.
 
It is also important that you eat more food and drink more 
nutrient shakes to get enough calories to support your body and 
not get dehydrated.  
  
You were also found to have fractures in your left foot.  The 
podiatrists saw you and recommended that you wear a boot and not 
put any weight on your left foot.  You have a follow-up 
appointment scheduled with them.
 
The following changes have been made to your medications.  
Change your metoprolol tartrate to 75 mg every 8 hours (three 
times per day).
Please take your iron supplement twice a day.
Please stop taking Lasix (furosemide), Cymbalta (duloxetine), 
and Ativan (lorazepam).

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top 
normal/borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular 
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending 
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
tricuspid regurgittaion is now more prominent and estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher. Left 
ventricular and right ventricular systolic function is less 
vigorous.  

___ CXR

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from ___ obtained of 
04:16 a.m. and chest radiograph from ___. 
  
The left lower lobe consolidation accompanied by pleural 
effusion is 
unchanged but there is overall progression of perihilar vascular 
engorgement continuing towards the right lower lung with small 
right pleural effusion present. The radiological picture is 
consistent with mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with the 
abnormality at the left lung being either a separate entity such 
as a pneumonia and parapneumonic effusion or potentially can be 
due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. 
  
ADDENDUM: Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ over the 
phone by Dr. ___ at 8:55 a.m. on ___. 

___ CXR

1. Increase in consolidation at the left lung base with slight 
increase in pleural effusion is concerning for pneumonia. 

2. CHF with new mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is unchanged. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year-old male with coronary artery disease, atrial 
fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type with neuropathy and tobacco 
dependance admitted ___ with productive cough and SOB for 3 
days. Patient was initially admitted to MICU, then medicine 
service, and finally to cardiology service prior to discharge. 
Hospital course was as follows.

1. Hypoxia:  Etiology likely multifactorial. On initial 
presentation, patient was with adequate O2 saturation on RA and 
became progressively hypoxic with IVF resuscitation and Afib 
with RVR.  Lobar pneumonia treated with good response with 
ceftriaxone (ten day course with 3 days of cefpodoxime 
prescribed at discharge) and azithromycin (5 day course).  Pt 
became fluid overloaded intermittently with shortness of breath, 
which responded well to 20mg IV furosemide.  Pt also experienced 
great symptomatic relief with brochodilators suggesting a 
brochospasm component to his dyspnea.  After several days of 
gentle diuresis, antibiotics and nebulizer treatments, patient 
was saturating 95% on room and breathing comfortably.  
Discharged on continued antibiotics, furosemide, and albuterol.

2. Chronic diastolic heart failure:  TTE on ___ revealed EF 
50-55% with minimal decrease in systolic function from prior 
TTE.  Evidence of pulmonary hypertension. On cardiology service, 
patient experienced tachypnea at night which appeared consistent 
with PND. He was given Lasix with good response.

3. Atrial fibrillation with RVR:  Patient has known atrial 
fibrillation and is status-post failed ablation. Suspect current 
worsening precipitated by CAP, hypoxia & long standing smoking 
history. Patient not anti-coagulated per Dr. ___ 
history of IVH from multiple falls.  He was treated with
