admission, treated with IVF and IV antiemetics, found to be C 
dif PCR positive, treated with IV flagyl and PO vancomycin. 

HOSPITAL COURSE:
===============
#CHEMOTHERAPY RELATED NAUSEA, VOMITING AND DIARRHEA
#MALNUTRITION: 
Patient started FOLFIRONIX eight days prior to admission. 
Reportedly developed N/V/D within 24h after its administration. 
Unfortunately worsened and persisted leading to inability to 
tolerate po intake. She was treated with IV zofran, compazine, 
and IVF. Electrolytes were optimally repleted and she was given 
IV thiamine 200mg x 3 days. She was found to be C. diff positive 
on PCR and was started on PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. The toxin 
c.diff was negative and antibiotics were stopped. Patient GERD 
medications were switched to PPI which greatly improved her 
symptoms.

#CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION
Patient found to be PCR positive for C. diff. Given her 
neutropenia, decision was made to initiate treatment while toxin 
results were pending. She was treated with IV flagyl and PO 
vancomycin. Toxin negative. Abx stopped. 

#NEUTROPENIA:
Patient received FOLFIRONIX ___. Prior to chemotherapy had ANC 
>6k. Noted to be 1580 on admission and continued to downtrend.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear. Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital because you had persistent nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea after receiving your chemotherapy. While 
you were here we treated you with medications and fluids to help 
with your nausea and vomiting. You were started on pantoprazole 
twice daily which helped your symptoms greatly. We treated you 
with antibiotics for a potential GI infection until your stool 
showed negative test results. At that time we stopped your 
antibiotics. Your ANC or neutrophils that fight infection 
started to increase and improve.

You had a paracentesis and had some of the ascites drained from 
your abdomen. Ultimately your symptoms improved, you were able 
to tolerate a regular diet, and you were ready to leave the 
hospital. 

Continue to the rest of your medications as prescribed. Please 
be sure to attend your follow up appointments as written below. 

It was a pleasure taking part in your care. Sincerely,

___ team

biliary obstruction and bacteremia (s/p stent placement in 
___, replaced several months later, prior blood cultures 
positive for VRE and CTX-R citrobacter), recurrent malignant 
ascites (s/p weekly paracentesis, most recently ___, malignant 
pleural effusions, portal vein thrombosis on apixaban, who 
presented with abdominal pain, confusion, fever and hypotension 
c/f acute cholangitis c/b septic shock on levophed and 
vasopressin for pressor support, now s/p ERCP with removal of 
purulent material occluding CBD stent, hospital course c/b GNR 
bacteremia on Zosyn and newly reduced EF by TTE, concerning for 
STEMI in the PDA distribution. 

ACUTE ISSUES 
======================= 
# SEPTIC SHOCK
# HEPATOBILIARY INFECTION
# GNR BACTEREMIA
History of recurrent cholangitis ___ biliary stent obstruction. 
Presented with abdominal pain, confusion, hypotension, fevers, 
leukocytosis, and lactic acidosis concerning for acute 
cholangitis c/b sepsis, s/p ERCP ___ with adequate source 
control and removal of biliary sludge occluding biliary stent. 
She was started on Zosyn for broad spectrum antimicrobial 
coverage. Her symptoms began to improve with objective clinical 
markers including a downtrending leukocytosis and resolving 
mixed cholestatic and hepatocellular transaminitis. Her initial 
set of blood cultures grew klebsiella oxytoca which was pan 
sensitive. She was switched to Ceftriaxone on ___ and then 
transitioned to ciprofloxacin for a 10 day course to finish on 
___ per Infectious Diseases. ERCP followed along and 
recommended the patient have a percutaneous biliary drainage, 
which the patient refused at this time. She was initially on 
levophed and vasopressin for blood pressure support, which was 
later weaned after she was started on midodrine for additional 
support. Surveillance cultures were drawn daily until no growth 
was detected. She had an A-line which was removed on ___. MAPs 
goal was set to above 60, which the patient maintained and was 
transitioned to midodrine. She was initially enrolled in the 
___ trial and was resuscitated the first 24 hours according 
to the protocol. Per Infectious Diseases, she was started on 
oral Bactrim DS 1 tab per day when she finishes ciprofloxacin to 
prevent future cholangitis. She should have a CBC, chem7, and 
LFTs drawn 7 days after starting Bactrim. 

# MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
# New HFrEF
Patient presented without chest pain or cardiovascular risk 
factors (does not have HTN, DM or dyslipidemia, no prior 
documented MI or CAD), however degree of troponinemia is 
worrisome (1.29->1.43->1.38), and unusual for a type II NSTEMI 
iso demand ischemia from a high output state such as her initial 
sepsis. Notably, TTE with findings of a newly reduced EF 
___, down from 67% by her most recent TTE this year) and 
regional wall motion abnormalities concerning for missed MI. 
Consulted cardiology who noted ST elevations in the PDA 
distribution, c/w patient's RWMA on TTE and reduced EF. Did not 
recommend any additional medical optimization given patient's 
coagulopathy, gram negative sepsis and pressor requirement at 
the time. Additionally, did not recommend cardiac 
catheterization. Held aspirin in the setting of elevated INR and 
low platelets. Held statin in the setting of transaminitis. She 
should have a repeat echocardiogram as an outpatient and 
consider starting a beta blocker when she is off of midodrine. 
She had no volume overload. 

# TRANSAMINITIS
Mixed cholestatic and hepatocellular picture. Likely iso acute 
liver injury from septic shock and hepatobiliary infection. Also 
has a history of portal vein thrombosis, but on anticoagulation 
for this. We trended daily LFTs, which downtrended and 
normalized upon discharge.

# STAGE IV METASTATIC PANCREATIC ADENOCARCINOMA
# MALIGNANT ASCITES
Had a diagnostic paracentesis in the ED which was negative for 
SBP (PMNs 178, normal gram stain). Peritoneal fluid cultures 
with no growth. Pancreatic lesion appears stable according to CT 
imaging with no interval changes. Gets weekly paracentesis with 
~4L of fluid usually removed. Currently on C4 FOLFOX. 
Communicated with oncologist Dr. ___ chemotherapy. She 
underwent therapeutic paracentesis on ___ with 5L removed that 
did not have SBP. She received 37.5g 25% albumin. She will 
continue to receive weekly paracentesis as an outpatient. 

# THROMBOCYTOPENIA
# ANEMIA
Anemia is stable. Thrombocytopenia likely in the setting of 
sepsis and GNR bacteremia. Initially concerning for possible 
MAHA or consumptive coagulopathy given elevated INR and LDH, but 
haptoglobin is slightly elevated above normal as is her
fibrinogen, which makes a DIC like picture less likely. Unlikely 
heparin induced thrombocytopenia given the absence of new or 
progressive arterial or venous thrombosis, no known prior 
heparin exposure in the last month after chart biopsy. Remained 
stable. 

# ELEVATED INR
Likely ___ acute liver injury and malnutrition. Unlikely 
consumptive coagulopathy, patient not on warfarin, acute liver 
failure (no encephalopathy). No e/o bleeding, hemoglobin stable. 
We continued to monitor daily coagulation profile with 
resolution. 

CHRONIC ISSUES 
======================= 
# PORTAL VEIN THROMBOSIS
# HX VTE
On rivaroxaban. Restarted after she had her ERCP. 

# MALNUTRITION
Pt with history of significant weight loss and poor PO intake. 

# HX C DIFF COLITIS
Treating with Vancomycin dosing for prophylaxis while on 
systemic antibiotics. She should continue these until instructed 
to discontinue by Infectious Diseases. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
[] Consider drawing LFTs with weekly paracentesis to look for 
early signs of infection 
[] Discuss need percutaneous biliary drainage
[] Repeat TTE as an outpatient

EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
INDICATION:  History: ___ with tachycardia, ams.  Evaluation for 
pna. 
TECHNIQUE:  Chest AP portable upright 
COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior chest radiograph from ___. 
FINDINGS:  
Right chest wall Port-A-Cath is again demonstrated, with tip 
extending to the low SVC.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
within normal limits.  Interval increase in moderate sized left 
pleural effusion with adjacent left lower lobe consolidation, 
likely representing a combination of effusion and atelectasis, 
however infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical 
setting.  
Right lung field is largely clear without evidence of focal 
consolidation.  No pneumothorax is seen. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Interval increase in moderate sized left pleural effusion with 
adjacent left lower lobe consolidation, likely representing a 
combination of effusion and atelectasis, however infection 
cannot be excluded in the appropriate clinical setting. 
 
___ RUQUS 
Final Report 
EXAMINATION:  CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Q111 CT HEAD 
INDICATION:  History: ___ with acute changes in mental status.  
Evaluation for intracranial hemorrhage. 
  
TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images of the brain were obtained 
without 
contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations as well as bone 
algorithm 
reconstructions were provided and reviewed. 
  
DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 
   1) Sequenced Acquisition 16.0 s, 16.0 cm; CTDIvol = 50.2 mGy 
(Head) DLP = 802.7 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Head) = 803 mGy-cm. 
  
COMPARISON:  Noncontrast head CT ___. 
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, acute large 
territory 
infarction, edema,or mass.  There is mild prominence of the 
ventricles and 
sulci suggestive of involutional changes.  Mild periventricular 
and 
subcortical hypodensities are nonspecific, though likely sequela 
of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  Atherosclerotic 
vascular calcifications are noted of bilateral vertebral and 
cavernous portions of internal carotid arteries. 
  
There is no evidence of fracture.  Mild mucosal thickening of 
the right 
maxillary sinus.  The visualized portion of the mastoid air 
cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.  The visualized 
portion of the orbits suggest bilateral drusen. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No acute intracranial abnormality. Please note MRI of the 
brain is more 
sensitive for the detection of acute infarct. 
2. Atrophy, probable small vessel ischemic changes, and 
atherosclerotic 
vascular disease as described.

There is interval placement of CBD stent.  The intrahepatic 
biliary ductal 
dilatation has slightly increased in extent from prior exam for 
which stent malfunction could be considered. The gallbladder is 
normal. 
  
PANCREAS: The pancreatic tail mass has slightly decreased in 
size from prior exam measuring 2.5 cm largest axial dimension, 
previously 3.1 cm (measured on MR 4.8 cm).  There remains 
extension and mass effect on the splenic vein similar to prior 
exam.  The hazy soft tissue stranding seen posterior to the 
pancreatic body (series 5, image 69) with mass-effect and 
narrowing of the splenic vein is similar to prior MRI.  The 
pancreatic head is normal.

lymphadenopathy.  There is no pelvic or inguinal 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
VASCULAR: In addition to above-mentioned finding, there is no 
abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Mild atherosclerotic disease is 
noted. 
  
BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or 
acute fracture.  Degenerative changes are seen in the spine. 
  
SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal 
limits. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Interval placement of CBD stent with slight increase in 
extent of 
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation for which stent 
malfunction could be considered. 
2. Interval decrease in size of pancreatic tail mass with 
persistent mass 
effect on the splenic vein. 
3. Stable hazy soft tissue stranding posterior to the pancreatic 
body causing 
unchanged splenic vein narrowing. 
4. Stable omental metastasis and moderate volume of malignant 
ascites. 
5. Interval increase in extent of large left pleural effusion 
with associated complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe. 
6. Interval increase in size of right ovarian cystic mass 
measuring 4.0 cm, previously 3.3 cm.

COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ 
  
FINDINGS:  
CHEST PERIMETER: Irregularly shaped low density region in the 
mildly enlarged left thyroid lobe is slightly larger today than 
in ___ and should be evaluated by ultrasound if not 
recently performed. 
  
7 mm left supraclavicular lymph nodes, 05:11, 12, are new.  
Right 
supraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes are not enlarged. 
  
Breast evaluation is reserved exclusively for mammography.  No 
soft tissue 
abnormalities elsewhere in the chest wall.  Findings below the 
diaphragm will be reported separately. 
  
CARDIO-MEDIASTINUM: Esophagus is unremarkable.  Atherosclerotic 
calcification is mild in head and neck vessels and at least left 
anterior descending coronary artery.  Aorta and pulmonary 
arteries are normal size, aortic valve is not calcified.  
Pericardium is physiologic. 
  
This study is not designed for definitive evaluation of 
pulmonary circulation but clearly shows a nearly 0 clues of 
thrombus centrally located in the are gin of the posterior basal 
segmental artery, right lower lobe, 6:191-200, which should be 
considered acute. 
  
There is also central thrombosis in the left subclavian and 
brachiocephalic veins, 6:87-124, with no clear extension into 
the SVC.  Central venous catheter currently extends from the 
right internal jugular to the superior cavoatrial junction with 
no indication of associated thrombosis. 
  
Pericardium is physiologic. 
 
THORACIC LYMPH NODES: No lymph nodes in the chest are 
pathologically enlarged. 
5 mm prevascular diaphragmatic node, 05:48, was slightly smaller 
in ___. 
  
LUNGS, AIRWAYS, PLEURAE: Focal lung lesions as follows: 
Aside from moderate subpleural atelectasis, lower lobe, right 
lung is clear. 
  
No appreciable right pleural effusion. 
  
Moderate to large dependent nonhemorrhagic left pleural 
effusion, 5 ___, is 
larger today than in ___ and largely responsible for 
collapse of the left lower lobe and some of the lingula, also 
more severe.  Pleural fluid is isointense with ascites and could 
be secondary to it.  There is no definite pleural nodulation. 
  
Left bronchial tree is patent centrally, collapsed peripherally 
in the regions of atelectasis, suggesting chronicity. 
  
CHEST CAGE: Although there are no bone lesions in the imaged 
chest cage 
suspicious for malignancy or infection, it should be noted that 
radionuclide 
bone and FDG PET scanning are more sensitive in detecting early 
osseous 
pathology than chest CT scanning. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
Moderate to large left pleural effusion has increased 
substantially since 
___ and ___ responsible for more severe atelectasis, 
collapsed lower left lower lobe and lingula. 

ERCP ___:
============
Impression: Sludge extraction, cholangiogram not performed due 
to neutropenia. No pus noted but given neutropenia this does not 
rule out cholangitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ with metastatic pancreatic CA c/b pleural effusions 
andascites on FOLFOX, biliary obstruction s/p metal stent 
(___), PVT on rivaroxaban, who presented on C1D3 with 
neutropenic fever, sepsis, transaminitis, found to have high
grade polymicrobial bacteremia, now s/p ERCP w/ sludge removal.

#POLYMICROBIAL BACTEREMIA
#CHOLANGITIS
#SEPSIS, RESOLVED
#NEUTROPENIC FEVERS:
Patient was admitted to the FICU with sepsis and transaminitis 
concerning for cholangitis. She was started on 
vanc/cefepime/flagyl on ___ and underwent ERCP on ___ which 
found significant biliary sludge. Following her ERCP, the 
patient was stable and she was called out of the FICU to the 
floor. Where she remained stable with downtrending LFTs and 
resolution of her sepsis. Her blood cultures grew VRE (sensitive 
to ampicillin) and Citrobacter. She was therefore transitioned 
to Zosyn monotherapy on ___. 

The patient was discharged on daptomycin 450mg IV q24H and 
ciprofloxacin 500mg q12H PO. Patient will not need follow up 
with ID OPAT as duration of treatment will be 2 weeks. Last day 
of treatment ___.

#SUBSEGMENTAL PE
#LEFT SUBCLAVIAN DVT
#PVT:
Patient was treated with rivaroxaban for her PVT. However, she 
had had to hold it for 2 days prior to her frequent outpatient 
paracentesis. Upon presentation she was found to have a 
subclavian DVT and sub segmental PEs. She was initially started 
on a heparin gtt, however, after discussion with her oncologist, 
this was not thought to be true treatment failure given her 
frequent need to hold her anticoagulation. After discussion with 
___ it was decided that the patient can hold her medication the 
day prior and morning of her procedure. It was therefore decided 
to continue her rivaroxaban with re-imaging to be planed as an 
outpatient. If her clot burden seems to increase, then she will 
be transitioned to lovenox. 

Given obvious biliary source and culture data, subclavian DVT 
unlikely to be source of prior sepsis.

#MAlIGNANT ASCITES: Underwent ___ guided para on ___ with removal 
of 4.5L. Procedure was tolerated well and she received 25g of 
25% albumin afterward. Cell counts and gram stain not c/w SBP.

#MALIGNANT PLEURAL EFFUSION (LEFT SIDED):
Enlarged from baseline. No increased WOB or hypoxia. Given 
stability and obvious biliary source of sepsis, there was no 
need to investigate with thoracentesis as cause of infection. 

#OROPHARYNGEAL CANDIDIASIS:
-Nystatin PO QID (day ___

#THROMBOCYTOPENIA: entering nadir from chemo

#METASTATIC PANCREATIC CANCER: Currently treated with FOLFOX. 
Will follow up with oncologist after discharge on ___

>30 minutes were spent coordinating care with outpatient 
providers, preparing paperwork and prescriptions

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You came to the hospital to have your port evaluated. You were 
found to have fevers and an infection of your biliary system. 
You underwent an ERCP to clear this infection and were started 
on IV antibiotics. You also had fluid drained from your abdomen 
which improved your symptoms of abdominal bloating. In addition, 
you were found to have a clot around your port which also caused 
blood clots in your lungs. After talking to your oncologist, 
this was thought to be due to you having you stop your 
rivaroxaban multiple times before paracentesis rather than the 
medication not working properly.

Therefore, prior to you getting an outpatient paracentesis, 
please hold it on the day before and the day of the procedure.

We are discharging you with an IV antibiotic called daptomycin 
in addition to an oral antibiotic called ciprofloxacin. It is 
very important that you take these medications are prescribed.

We wish you the best!

Your ___ Care team

Imaging: 
Paracentesis ___:
Technically successful ultrasound guided therapeutic 
paracentesis. 
4 L of fluid were removed. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH metastatic pancreatobiliary carcinoma (omentum, 
peritoneum, porta hepatis, pancreatic tail and right ovary), c/b 
biliary obstruction + bacteremia (s/p ERCP/stent), PE, and 
malignant ascites (s/p weekly paracentesis), who presented from 
clinic with malaise and elevated LFTs suggestive of cholangitis, 
improved on Abx without endoscopic intervention, was discharged 
home to complete course of antibiotics

#OBSTRUCTIVE JAUNDICE
#CONCERN FOR CHOLANGITIS:
Patient presented from clinic with malaise, chills and elevated 
LFTs suggestive of biliary obstruction. Given history of 
multiple episodes of cholangitis and bacteremia with VRE and 
Citrobacter, patient was started on Zosyn and improved. 24 hrs 
later WBC/Tbili normalized, AST/ALT downtrended. Given temporary 
nature of lab findings and improvement with IV abx, patient may 
have had temporary obstruction from small stone/sludge which has 
since
passed. During hospitalization, blood cx did not return 
positive. 

Pt therefore treated for early cholangitis, with plan for 7 day 
course of PO antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) given negative 
cultures. Last day ___

#Malignant Ascites
Given that patient presented with chills, malaise, leukocytosis 
and c/f infection, would have been nice to see ascites studies, 
but none were sent during ___ guided procedure. Patient was 
without any abdominal symptoms though which argues against SBP 
and was on empiric abx course as above. Ascites had 
reaccumulated somewhat by time of discharge but was not yet in 
need of repeat paracentesis. Patient had appt scheduled for 5 
days later (weekly on ___ which she was encouraged to keep. 


#Oral candidiasis
Continue nystatin, to be re-evaluated at next onc followup to 
ensure has completely resolved. 

#Hyponatremia
Mild, likely due to hypovolemia, resolved with albumin/IVF

#Hx OF PE/DVT AND PVT: 
On rivaroxaban at home but was on hold for possible ERCP with 
heparin gtt in meantime. Returned to home anticoagulation on 
discharge

#Metastatic pancreatobiliary carcinoma : 
Currently being treated with FOLFOX. Dr ___ regarding 
discharge in case she wanted to adjust patient's followup plan.

#Anemia
Chronic, stable, near baseline. To be trended in outpatient 
setting by oncology team.

I personally spent 49 minutes preparing discharge paperwork, 
educating patient/family, answering questions, and coordinating 
care with outpatient providers

Ms ___

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay. As you 
know, you were admitted for a possible infection of your biliary 
system. Fortunately, with antibiotics, your labs improved and 
you felt better. It is possible that we had caught your 
infection early, and the sludge or small stone resolved without 
intervention. 

You should continue antibiotics on discharge for an additional 4 
days and follow up with your oncologist. If you develop a 
recurrence of altered mental status, fever, or are feeling 
unwell, please return to the ER.

compared to prior

RUQUS:
1. Moderate to large volume ascites.
2. Main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.
3. CBD stent in place without evidence of intrahepatic biliary
ductal dilation.

CXR:
Large partially layering left pleural effusion likely with
associated compressive lower lobe atelectasis, similar to
findings on recent CT of the chest. Port-A-Cath positioned
appropriately. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ PMH metastatic pancreatic CA (c/b pleural effusions 
and ascites on FOLFOX s/p Cycle 2), biliary obstruction (s/p
metal stent),  DVT/PE/PVT (on rivaroxaban), who presented with
fatigue and dyspnea I/s/o abdominal distention. 

#Fatigue
#Malignant ascites
Likely related to recent chemotherapy and respiratory compromise 
caused by reaccumulation of malignant ascites. Pt gets 
outpatient paras approximately every 2 weeks. Number of 
neutrophils on peritoneal sample decreased compared to prior, 
and no abdominal pain/tenderness arguing against SBP. No fever 
to suggest infection. CXR negative for infiltrate. Patient felt 
breathing and energy was much improved after her paracentesis. 
___ was not consulted as the patient was ambulating 
independently. 

#Mild Lower extremity swelling
Patient presented with b/l leg swelling, has hx of PVT but RUQUS
showed no recurrence. Given new finding, and elevated BNP, TTE 
was ordered but EF was preserved at 67% with no evidence of 
major valvular/diastolic dysfunction. Cr was normal as well. 
Held diuresis on day of paracentesis, restarted on discharge.

#Leukocytosis
Likely related to neulasta onpro placed on ___. Less likely 
infection given lack of localizing symptoms

#Thrombocytopenia (nadir 50 on ___
HIT score calculates intermediate probability of HIT however 
after speaking with oncologist it was felt that plt drop is more 
likely related to chemotherapy. 

#Recent VRE/Citrobacter Bacteremia
On last admission had bacteremia as a result of cholangitis and
was s/p ERCP with sludge removal. PEr ID, to be treated with 2
week course of Abx ending ___.  We continue dapto/cipro for an 
addition 48 hrs until Cx clearly
demonstrate no recurrence

#Thrush
Continued nystatin 

#Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
S/p C2 FOLFOX with neulasta support just days prior to 
admission. Dr ___.

#Transaminitis
ALT 166, AST191, LD 518, ALP 328 Tbili 1.0
Fluctuating since ___, with rising AP concerning for possible
disease progression as RUQUS showed CBD stent in place without 
evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal  dilation. 

#PVT/DVT/PE Hx
Switched rivaroxaban to heparin gtt in preparation for ___
paracentesis. Switched back to rivaroxaban the next day as PLT 
count was low. No bleeding events.
