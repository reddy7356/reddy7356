He was admitted at ___ 5 days ago with the same symptoms. On that 
admission, he improved with antiemetics (zofran, compazine, 
phenergan) and morphine. IV fluids were given until the patient 
was able to tolerate PO. On the last admission his narcotic 
regimen was decreased, since it was though that it was

Renal impressed that this was the same presentation as his 
previous episodes of gastroparesis and may have been affected by 
his narcotic use. They recommended continuing immunosupressants, 
advancing to clears and limiting narcotic use. GI impressed that 
his symptoms are likely due to gastroparesis, but still supected 
SBO or PUD. They were also concered about possible MW tear.  
.  
ROS was otherwise negative. The pt denied recent unintended 
weight loss, fevers, night sweats, chills, headaches, dizziness 
or vertigo, changes in hearing or vision, neck stiffness, 
lymphadenopathy, hematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, dysphagia,

now with recurrent admissions for abdominal pain and nausea and 
vomitting.
.
# Abdominal Pain - Mr. ___ has had ___ admissions over the 
past year s/p pancreas transplant for abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting and inability to tolerate PO intake.  On this 
admission, he was admitted with similar presentation.  He was 
made NPO, placed on IV maintenance fluids and continued on 
pro-motility agents (IV) and treated with Dilaudid 0.5 IV prn.  
KUB on admission showed no evidence of perforation or 
obstrution.  CT Scan of abdomen showed a very small fluid 
collection at the head of the transplant pancreas that was 
stable isnce previous scans.  while likely post-surgical, mild 
edematous pancreatitis could not be ruled out.  EGD showed 
esophagitis and gastritis and GI recommeneded BID PPI and 
carafate solution for treatment.   There was concern for 
possible transplant rejection so tacro and siroliums levels were 
checked and determined to be low.  Solumedrol IV was given for 
three days until Tacrolimus and Sirolimus levels added to 9, 
which they did on day of discharge.  Due to lack of findings on 
imaging and studies, it  was felt that abdominal pain was most 
likely ___ long standing gastroparesis.  Abdominal pain resolved 
on the day of discharge, patient's diet was advanced and he 
tolerated a regular diet with no nausea or emesis.  He was 
discharge with a 2 week supply of dilaudid to follow-up with his 
transplant physician.  
.
# S/P Pancreatic Transplant - Transplant ___, currently on 
tacrolimus and sirolimus. Compliance was questionable prior to 
admission due to emesis.  Prograf levels were determined to be 
subtherapeutic on admission.  Due to inability to tolerate PO, 
prograf capsules were broken in half and given sublingually.  
Additionally, Solumedrol IV was given for three days while 
immunosupressant levels were low.  On day of discharge, patient 
was tolerating PO with no emesis or nausea x 24 hours.  Patient 
was instructed to take Prograf SL in the future if unable to 
take medications due to emesis or nausea.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ w DM1 with gastroparesis, neuropathy s/p pancreas transplant 
___, here w/ N/V/dehydration/abdominal pain, transferred 
from Transplant Surgery service for continued symptomatic 
management.  
.
# Abdominal pain: This is likely ___ gastroparesis, as pt has 
had similar previous admissions for abdominal pain/n/v that have 
resolved with IVF hydration and symptomatic control. Pain and 
nausea were well controlled on a regimen of Morphine ___ IV q4 
PRN, Zofran 4mg IV q8 PRN, Compazine PRN nausea. By day of 
discharge, pain was still present but low-grade and manageable. 
Pt was tolerating POs. He was sent home with a limited 
prescription for PO Dilaudid.

# Elevated LFTs: During last few days of admission, LFTs had 
been uptrending. Liver was consulted, and it was thought that 
this could be secondary to inflammation in the setting of 
recently elevated Tacrolimus levels. Hep C viral load were 
re-checked given concern for reactivation in setting of 
immunosuppresion, and was undetectable. Hep B viral load was 
also negative. Pt was sent home on reduced dose of Tacrolimus. 
LFTs were down-trending on day of discharge.
.    
# s/p Pancreatic transplant: on ___. Post-op course has 
included several admissions for gastroparesis as above. Dosing 
of Tacrolimus was adjusted as above, and home MMF and 
Fludrocortisone were continued. Pt is also continued on Bactrim 
SS qday and Valcyte 900 PO qday for prophylaxis.

# IDDM: now off insulin s/p pancreatic transplant. Continue 
Gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy, Reglan for gastroparesis.
.
# Anxiety: continue home Duloxetine, Topamax, Diazepam PRN

___ CT abdomen/pelvis
CT ABDOMEN: The lung bases are clear. There is no pericardial or 
pleural 
effusion. The liver is unremarkable except to note small area of 
focal fatty 
infiltration adjacent to the ligamentum teres (2, 26). The 
gallbladder is 
unremarkable. The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are normal 
in 
appearance. Small bowel loops are normal in caliber and without 
focal wall 
thickening. There is no free fluid or free air. 
  
CT OF THE PELVIS: Patient is status post right lower quadrant 
pancreatic 
transplant. The pancreas appears to enhance homogenously. Small 
amount of 
fluid adjacent to the pancreatic head is again identified and 
not 
significantly changed when compared to prior exam. There is no 
change in 
peripancreatic fluid stranding or new collections identified. 
The rectum, 
sigmoid colon, bladder and prostate gland are unremarkable. 
There is no 
pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. 

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions 
identified

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable appearance of right lower quadrant pancreatic 
transplant with small 
amount of fluid adjacent to the pancreatic head, unchanged. No 
new fluid 
collections or peripancreatic fat stranding identified. 

CXR ___:
No interval occurrence of infectious or other abnormalities.  
Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, no pleural effusions. 
Known right 
aortic arch. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#. Abdominal Pain:  On presentation to the ED, patient was 
febrile to 101.3 with severe abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, 
leukocytosis of 8.1 with 88% neutrophils and a serum lactate of 
5.3.  His pain was initially treated with dilaudid IV prn, his 
nausea was treated with zofran, and he was made NPO  Initially 
there was a concern for pancreas rejection, intraabdominal 
infection or bowel infarction.  A CT of the abdomen was 
performed, which showed the transplant to be unchanged from 
prior studies, and no other obvious cause of his pain.  
Transplant surgery was consulted, who attributed his pain to 
gastroparesis given the similarity of his presentation to prior 
presentations. Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended 
testing for more unusual abdominal pain syndromes, such as heavy 
metal poisoning, familial Mediterranean fever and porphyria, all 
of which were pending on discharge. On subsequent days, his 
fever, leukocytosis and elevated lactate resolved.  His diet was 
advanced to a regular diabetic diet, and his pain was controlled 
with PO dilaudid and his home fentanyl patch.  Patient initially 
had hypoactive bowel sounds, and few bowel movements, but 
retained normal bowel function throughout this hospitalization.  
Patient was discharged with his home regimen of fentanyl patch, 
with vicodin for breakthrough pain.  
.
#. s/p pancreas transplant:  On initial presentation, serum 
rapamune and tacrolimus levels were depressed at 3.1 and 3.1 
respectively.  Patient was given a loading dose of 6mg of 
rapamune once, and his dose was increased to 4mg PO daily.  
Tacrolimus dose was increased to 4mg PO bid.  Subsequent 
rapamune and tacrolimus levels were 12.5 and 5.9, in the 
therapeutic range.  Tacrolimus dose was decreased to 3mg PO bid 
on discharge. Daily fasting glucose was stable, ranging from 83 
to 104.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man w/hx of DM1, gastroparesis, s/p pancreas tx ___ on 
Prograf and Cellcept, now presents with nausea/vomiting and 
abdominal pain consistent with prior episodes of gastroparesis.

# Gastroparesis: The patient's symptoms were consistent with 
previous episodes of gastroparesis and resolved with antiemetics 
(zofran, compazine, phenergan) and morphine. IV fluids were 
given until the patient was able to tolerate PO. KUB ruled out 
obstruction or perforation. LFTs and lipase were unremarkable. 
Mr. ___ did have a single fever to 100.3.  Blood cultures 
were drawn and have been negative to date.  Urine cultures were 
negative. There was no evidence of perforation on KUB.  There 
was no evidence of respiratory etiology on exam. There were no 
further temperature spikes and no source of infection was 
identified.
The patient has been receiving narcotics on each hospitalization 
for gastroparesis.  Since this is not an ideal agent for 
gastroparesis or abdominal pain, he was weaned from pain 
medications on this admission. Fentanyl patch dose was reduced 
from 75mcg (home dose) to 50mcg. He was discharged on a limited 
supply of PO morphine as abdominal pain had not completely 
resolved on discharge. He was advised to follow up with PCP in 
terms of fentanyl patch dosing and pain management.

# S/p pancreatic transplant: There was no evidence of rejection 
on admission. Tacrolimus level was 5.6 on admission. Myfortic 
was stopped.  He was started on Mycophenolate Mofetil 250mg BID 
and sirolimus 3mg PO Qdaily and continued on tacrolimus.  
Mycophenolate mofetil will be stopped once sirolimus is 
therapeutic. He was instructed to have tacrolimus and sirolimus 
levels checked on ___, which will be followed by Dr.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o M w/ h/o DM c/b gastroparesis, s/p pancreatic transplant 
p/w severe nausea, vomiting, now with a primary respiratory 
alkalosis with an acute metabolic acidosis, and an anion gap 
acidosis and abdominal pain c/w prior episodes of gastroparesis.
.
Brief Hospital Course By Problem: 
.
#) Abdominal Pain: per patient, the pain, nausea and vomiting 
were all consistent with prior gastroparesis flares.  The pain 
was severe, most intense in the epigastric region but his entire 
abdomen hurt.  Patient initially made npo, with IVF, IV dilaudid 
for pain control, and four anti-emetics (zofran, phenergen, 
compazine and reglan) for nausea and ativan for nausea/anxiety, 
a combination that had worked well in the past.  He was 
initially requiring about ___ of dilaudid over 24 hours for 
pain control.  KUB done on admission did not show any sign of 
obstruction.  Over the next ___ hours his pain and nausea 
improved and he was able to be transitioned to oral pain and 
nausea medications.  Additionally, as his pain/nausea improved 
he was able to restart all of his outpatient medications.  On 
hospital day #2 he was able to tolerate clear liquids, and all 
medications were converted from IV to PO.  He was sent home on 
clear liquids, and po dilaudid for pain and zofran for nausea.
.
#) Respiratory Alkalosis with concurrent metabolic acidosis and 
anion gap acidosis:  Primary respiratory alkalosis seen on 
admission VBG, likely acute due to hyperventilation secondary to 
abdominal pain and anxiety.  On admission chem 7, patient with 
evidence of  anion gap acidosis, which raised concern for either 
lactic acidosis since it was elevated at 2.9 or possibly 
unrecognized DKA.  After pancreatic transplant he had not needed 
any insulin, but had an transiently elevated fingerstick and his 
urine had 1000 glucose and 150 ketones at the time of admission. 
 After fluid resuscitation with normal saline, his lactate 
normalized, his anion gap closed and remainder of his 
fingersticks were all under 150.  On repeat urinalysis he no 
longer had any glucose in his urine.  Also, once his pain was 
controlled, his respiratory rate normalized, helping to correct 
the primary respiratory alkalosis. 
.
#) Electrolyte Abnormalities: on admission patient was found to 
have a phosphorous of 0.7, which was repleted with IV 
phosphorous.  The etiology of his hypophosphatemia was thought 
to be due to hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis, which 
led to a decrease in CO2 in cells causing a rise in 
intracellular pH.  The increased intracellular pH turns on 
phosphofructokinase and glycolysis, leading to depletion of 
serum phosphorous.  After initial repletion with IV phosphorous, 
he did not require further repletion.  
.
#) Pancreatic Transplant: patient is status post pancreatic 
transplant on ___, initial tacrolimus levels were 
subtherapeutic as he had been unable to keep his medications 
down at home.  The dosing was changed, so the capsules were 
broken apart and the powder placed sublingually, and repeat 
tacrolimus level was 18.5.  Once his nausea resolved, he was 
also again able to tolerate his rapamune.

Abdominal X-ray ___:
FINDINGS: Three frontal radiographs of the abdomen are obtained. 
The bowel
gas pattern reveals a moderate amount of gas throughout the 
colon with no
evidence of obstruction or ileus. Chain sutures and metallic 
clips projecting
in the right pelvis are consistent with history of pancreatic 
transplant.
There is no free gas or pneumatosis. The included osseous 
structures are
unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION: Non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
#. Abdominal Pain/Nausea and Vomiting.  In the emergency patient 
was treated with dilaudid IV which relieved his symptoms.  An 
abdominal x-ray was unremarkable.  On the floor, he tolerated PO 
intake and advanced to a regular diet.  His pain was treated 
with his home dose fentanyl patch and PO dilaudid.   His dose of 
dilaudid was gradually reduced from ___ PO q 3 hours to 1 mg 
PO q 4 hours.  As gastroenterology was consulted on a prior 
admission and did not believe that his recurrent presentations 
were consistent with gastroparesis, it was considered that 
narcotics dependence may be a significant part of his current 
presentation.  Social work was consulted and considered both 
inpatient and outpatient detoxification options.  Patient did 
not qualify for outpatient detox programs, as he is currently 
taking large doses of diazepam.  Inpatient detox was an option 
but there was no availability for ___ days.  Patient preferred 
to enroll at a later date, and was discharged with no additional 
prescriptions for narcotics.

#. s/p pancreas transplant.  On admission his serum tacrolimus 
level was therapeutic at 6.4, and his serum rapamune level was 
3.4 which was subtherapeutic.  He was given his home doses of 
tacrolimus 3 mg PO bid and rapamune 4 mg PO daily, and his serum 
levels of both drugs remained in the therapeutic range for the 
rest of his hospitalization. Serum and amylase levels were 
normal throughout this hospitalization.
