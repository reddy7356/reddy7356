Pertinent Results:
CT ___ 
1. Marked improvement in appearance of the lungs, compatible 
with resolution of ARDS. Previously present pneumothorax is also 
resolved. Small bilateral pleural effusions are decreased in 
size. There is residual atelectasis, most apparent posteriorly 
in the right lower lobe. Nodular densities as above may 
represent resolving inflammatory change, though attention on 
follow-up examinations is warranted. 
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolus, as questioned. 
3. Hyperdense collection within the right axilla/right chest 
wall, with focus of hyperdensity on post-contrast imaging. This 
is compatible with hematoma with active extravasation, though 
this may be venous.  
4. Diffuse dilation of the small bowel, without definite 
transition point, 
and without imaging evidence of ischemia. This most likely 
reflects ileus. 
5. Decreased free fluid in the pelvis, with no loculated fluid 
collection to suggest abscess formation. 
6. Redemonstration of high-grade stenosis at the origin of the 
celiac axis, patent SMA stent, and occlusion of ___ stent. 
7. Known right adrenal lesion, previously characterized as an 
adenoma. 

CXR: SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: A right 
subclavian line has been removed, the left upper extremity PICC 
terminates with the catheter tip just above the cavoatrial 
junction in the distal SVC. Bibasilar lung opacities have 
continually improved, with no current consolidation. Small 
residual left pleural effusion is seen. A soft tissue density at 
the right pleural surface laterally is is decreased from prior 
radiographs. There is no evidence of persistent pneumothorax. 
Multiple right-sided chronic rib fractures are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Dr. ___ surgery 
service on ___. Her surgeries were as follows - ___, 
ex-lap and small bowel resection; ___, ex-lap and small 
bowel resection (second look), angiogram, angioplasty of ___, 
take-back later that evening for bleeding; ___, angiogram, 
angioplasty and stenting of SMA. Patient stayed in the ICU for 
monitoring and observation. She was eventually extubated, 
maintained on TPN for nutrition, and transferred to general 
floor on ___. On discharge, she was tolerating a regular 
diet with daily TPN (due to inadequate caloric intake) via PICC 
line access, on room air with normal bowel function. 

Her hospital course can be summarized by the following review of 
symptoms - 

Neuro: Patient with minimal pain and only requiring Tylenol with 
relief of symptoms on discharge. She was started on Seroquel 
while in ICU for delirium and ICU psychosis which resolved since 
transfer from the unit. She continues to take that medication as 
needed for insomnia.

Pulm: Patient did develop an iatrogenic pneumothorax from a 
central line access change. Chest tube was placed and then 
removed with resolution. Intubated for respiratory distress from 
hypovolemic shock. She was treated briefly for ventilator 
associated pneumonia with broad spectrum antibiotics. Patient 
self-extubated and did require re-intubation due to respiratory 
distress. She was eventually extubated and maintained normal 
oxygen saturations. She is discharged on room air. 

Cardio: No cardiac issues. Echo performed showing normal 
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function and prominent epicardial fat 
pad. Did not require vasopressor support. 

GI: Had an exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection. 
Observed closely in the ICU. Chronic malnourished state, 
requiring TPN for additional caloric intake. She was advanced to 
a regular diet on discharge. Tolerating without issues but still 
taking inadequate amounts. Patient's stool output was followed 
closely to avoid dehydration. All C.diff stool tests were 
negative. Pls continue to use famotidine (included in TPN). 

Renal: Patient auto-diuresing without issues. Renal asked to 
consult for polyuria. Cultures negative for UTI. Recommendations 
to decrease the solute concentrate in TPN. Continues to urinate 
without issues.

ID: Treated for ischemic bowel and given antibiotics for 
ventilator associated pneumonia. Her course was completed. WBC 
was 4.5 on discharge and continues to be afebrile. Discharged on 
no antibiotics.

Heme: Patient will be discharged on aspirin and Plavix for stent 
prophylaxis. She should continue to be on subcutaneous heparin 
for DVT prophylaxis.

Endo: Patient placed on an insulin sliding scale for coverage. 
No issues with 
hypo/hyperglycemia

IMAGING/STUDIES
-CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ___: 1. No retroperitoneal hematoma or 
evidence of other acute abdominopelvic pathology. 2. Unchanged 
left adrenal adenoma. 3. Cholelithiasis.

-CTA ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/ contrast ___: -No evidence of active 
extravasation or alternative explanation for the patient's acute 
anemia. -Chronically occluded SMA and ___ stents. No evidence of 
bowel ischemia. -Ill-defined hypodensities scattered throughout 
the spleen may suggest splenic
infarct or perfusional anomaly. -Stable left adrenal gland 
lesion, likely an adenoma. -Gallstones without evidence of 
cholecystitis.

-KUB ___: Nonspecific, nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.

-KUB ___: Gaseous distension of both large and small bowel 
loops extending to the rectum
most consistent with ileus.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o CAD, mesenteric ischemia s/p aorto SMA stenting, PAD w/ 
multiple angioplasties/stentings, ischemic colitis/Mesenteric 
ischemia who was seen by her PCP after near syncope found to 
have anemia hemoglobin 5.  She was first sent to ___ 
___ where she received 2Units of PRBC and was then 
transferred to ___ for higher level care.

1. Acute on chronic normocytic anemia h/o hematuria and GI bleed
-Hemoglobin at ___'s office and ___ prior to 
admission was ___ s/p 2Units PRBC. Heme occult positive with 
reports of ___ prior to admission.  Patient with recent 
hospitalization w/ hematuria while on coumadin w/ accidental 
overdose w/ supra therapeutic INR 14.  She was switched to 
xarelto with resolution of hematuria. CTA w/out evidence of 
retroperitoneal or GI bleed. Labs not consistent w/hemolysis. 
Labs also not consistent with pancytopenia suggesting marrow 
pathology. During last admission there were investigations into 
anemia without any etiology.  Last colonoscopy and EGD ___ 
grossly normal other than transverse colon stricture. She is due 
for repeat colonoscopy ___. GI consulted with plans for 
colonoscopy and EGD.  EGD ___ grossly normal.   Hemoglobin 
was stable after initial transfusion.  Aspirin and xarelto were 
held. 

2. Abdominal pain  
-Despite h/o ischemic/mesenteric ischemia, a CTA at time of 
admission was without evidence of ischemia and her lactate was 
normal.  KUB noted illeus as likely cause of pain.  However, on 
___ AM she developed acute abdominal pain and was found to 
have lactate of 10.5. CTA was obtained that showed new acute 
occlusion of the SMA limb of the supra-celiac aorta- SMA bypass. 
Discussions were had with the patient regarding her goals of 
care and she wanted everything done at this time.  She was 
urgently taken to the operating room and underwent angiogram, 
which confirmed an occluded graft (with both limbs occluded).  
She then underwent thrombectomy and placement of a TPA lysis 
catheter.  Overnight, her lactate continued to rise, and she was 
hemodynamically unstable, requiring pressors and increasing vent 
settings.  Early in the morning, she was taken again to the 
operating room for a repeat angiogram, this time with both 
vascular surgery and the acute care general surgery service.  
She underwent an exploratory laparotomy, extensive lysis of 
adhesions, arteriotomy of the previous vein patch in her Dacron 
graft, and open thrombectomy.  Although Doppler confirmed 
re-established inflow, there was evidence of poor back bleeding, 
and suspected distal thrombosis that could not be reached.  A 
segment of small bowel was found to have a perforation, and as a 
result, that small section of bowel was resected.  Her remaining 
bowel appeared dusky.  She was left in discontinuity with an 
abdominal wound vac and plans for ongoing resuscitation.  At the 
time of transfer from the operating room to the ICU, she was 
requiring three pressors for support and her lactate had risen 
to 19.  Her metabolic acidosis worsened and she continued to 
require high dose pressors.  

3. Multiorgan failure and septic shock
By ___, ___ had developed evidence of end organ ischemia 
involving multiple organs.  She had renal failure (became 
anuric), liver failure (elevated liver enzymes) and poor 
perfusion (upper and lower extremities mottled with weak 
pulses).  Her family was informed of her grim prognosis.  The 
likely cause was septic shock.  Ongoing discussions were had 
regarding goals of care.  Ultimately, the family and HCP decided 
to change her code status from full code to do not resuscitate 
on ___.  They then decided to pursue comfort measures only 
and ___ expired quickly thereafter.  She was pronounced dead at 
2:58pm on ___.  The family declined an autopsy and the 
decision was made not to call the medical examiner.

3. Syncope/near syncope h/o orthostatic hypotension
-Clinical presentation consistent with symptomatic anemia.
-Was continued on fludrocortisone.

4. Nausea/vomiting
-KUB without obstruction, otherwise no clear etiology at first.  
Was given PRN antiemetics.
-Troponin on admission negative (?nausea as angina equivalent). 

5. Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia
-Likely in setting of vomiting and prep-induced diarrhea.
-Monitored and repleted as needed. 

CHRONIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS
1. Ischemic colitis and mesenteric ischemia s/p stenting w/ 
chronic in-stent thrombosis, PAD, CAD: held aspirin and xarelto 
on admission, as CTA initially not concerning for ischemic 
colitis. Continued statin.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with a history of MI, PVD, 
mesenteric ischemia s/p SMA bypass, most recently s/p exlap and 
SMA thrombectomy on Coumadin who is presenting with dark stools, 
lightheadedness and shortness of breath found to have an INR of 
8.5 and Hgb 6.1.

Per patient, she was called today and notified that her INR was 
8.5. Patient denies chest pain. She states that for the past 
week she has noticed dark stools, but denies blood. She also 
endorses a lightheadedness after she stands up as well as a 
dyspnea on exertion for the past 2 days. She denies fevers, 
chills, but endorses a recent upper respiratory illness.

Patient was tearful about admission in the ED and wanted to 
leave against medical advice. She was advised that her blood was 
thin and blood counts were low, would be very dangerous to leave 
hospital. After discussion patient agreed to stay. Patient well 
appearing, asymptomatic, HDS.  

In the ED, initial VS were 98.4 71 101/52 18 100% RA .  

Exam notable for:  
Lungs clear to auscultation, no lower extremity edema, brown 
guaiac positive stool  

Imaging showed No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.

The patient initially had an INR of 7.8 and hemoglobin of 6.1.  
She received 10 mg IV vitamin K.  She received 3 units of PRBCs. 
 On recheck her INR was 1.7 and her hemoglobin trended up to 
8.9.  She was also given IV pantoprazole. GI was consulted, and 
they recommended inpatient versus outpatient colonscopy pending 
clinical course(ie not responding to transfusions, or continued 
melena). Vascular surgery recommended: continuation of aspirin 
and statin and resumption of warfarin when stable. 

Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports that she is feeling 
better and would like to eat. Her last episode of bloody bowel 
movements was earlier this AM. She shares that intermittently 
her INR will become low, and she will be called to increase her 
dose, which happened recently (most recently 3 mg 4x/week, 6 mg 
3x/week). She uses a pill box to keep track of her warfarin. She 
denies any new medications or dietary changes recently.
Of note, patient does report history of easy bleeding including 
gingival bleeding, also has had heavy periods such that she 
required hysterectomy. Unclear if she had ever been evaluated 
for bleeding/clotting disorders in past.

IMAGING:

___ CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old lady with history of MI, peripheral 
vascular disease, recurrent mesenteric ischemia s/p SMA bypass, 
most recently s/p ex-lap and SMA thrombectomy (___) on warfarin 
who presented with melena, lightheadedness, and shortness of 
breath in setting of acute blood loss anemia and 
supratherapeutic INR.

# Acute blood loss anemia
# Melena
Admission Hgb 6.1 in setting of INR 7.8. She received 10 mg IV 
vitamin K as well as total of 3u pRBC and IV pantoprazole. She 
was seen by GI who recommended consideration of inpatient versus 
outpatient colonoscopy pending clinical course (i.e., inpatient 
scope if not responding to transfusions or continued melena). 
She was also seen by our vascular surgery team given history of 
mesenteric ischemia who recommended aspirin, statin, as well as 
resumption of warfarin when safe to do so, follow up with Dr. 
___. 
After admission, her H/H and BP were monitored closely, and she 
remained hemodynamically stable and H/H stable. She had no 
further episodes of melena. Warfarin was held until day of 
discharge, management as below. On discharge Hgb 8.9. She will 
require recheck CBC on ___ to ensure stable. 

# Supratherapeutic INR
Admission INR of 7.8, possible contributing factor of recent 
corticosteroid use in setting of URI; there is some literature 
to support interaction between predisone and warfarin ___ 
Pharmacother. ___;40(12):2101-6). Otherwise patient denies 
any change in vitamin K intake/diet changes, and shares that she 
uses a pill box to keep track of her warfarin dosing. 

Per patient she notes occasional episodes of low INR requiring 
dose adjustments which is occasionally confusing, but she uses a 
pill box to keep track of her medications and reports that she 
has been taking her warfarin as instructed. No recent changes in 
her diet. We briefly considered whether she would be a good 
candidate for alternate anticoagulants such as the DOACs, 
although upon further questioning it appears that patient has 
had easy gum bleeding as well as heavy menses necessitating 
hysterectomy in past, raising suspicion for possible bleeding 
disorder such as vWD and overall would prefer reversible agent. 
We did not send any testing while in house as she had received 
transfusions and was recently on anticoagulation, but can 
consider as outpatient. We opted to restart her on warfarin at 3 
mg daily which per patient was prior home dose. Discharge INR 
was 1.1. She will require recheck INR on ___. 

# History of recurrent mesenteric ischemia: As above, seen by 
vascular surgery while in house, recommended aspirin, statin, 
and restarting warfarin. Of note, patient was not on aspirin or 
statin at home despite history of PVD, recurrent mesenteric 
ischemia, and report of MI. 

# CAD: Started atorvastatin 40 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily. 
Patient is not on betablocker, consider as outpatient. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
- Discharge Hgb 8.9, discharge INR 1.1
[] Discharged on warfarin 3 mg daily, please recheck CBC and INR 
on ___ and adjust warfarin dose as needed
- Started aspirin 81 mg daily and atorvastatin 40 mg daily given 
history of recurrent mesenteric ischemia, PVD, and CAD; patient 
did not report any adverse reactions to these in past, unclear 
why stopped
[] Consider further work up of ?bleeding disorder as outpatient 
given report of heavy menses, gum bleeding
[] Consider beta blocker as outpatient given reported history of 
CAD s/p MI

Greater than 30 minutes spent in care coordination and 
counseling on the day of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at ___!

You came to us because of black stools concerning for bleeding 
from your gastrointestinal tract in the setting of a 
supratherapeutic INR. 
We do not have a definite answer as to why your INR was high 
prior to coming in, although you did report taking prednisone, 
which can sometimes interact with warfarin. 
While you were here, we supported you with blood transfusions 
and held your home warfarin. We also monitored your blood counts 
closely. Our GI doctors and our ___ surgeons evaluated you, 
and it was thought that you did not need an endoscopy as an 
inpatient as you responded well to transfusions, and your stools 
were no longer black. 

We considered whether warfarin was the best medication for you 
as you reported occasional fluctuations in your INR 
necessitating changes in dosing, and some complexity in 
management (as you would be on alternate day dosing). However, 
at the same time, you reported that when you were younger you 
had issues with heavy bleeding necessitating hysterectomy as 
well as prolonged bleeding from your gums, hence we would prefer 
an agent that can be reversed easily. Overall, we think that you 
may benefit from testing for bleeding disorders, however we were 
unable to do this in the hospital because you received 
transfusions and the results would be difficult to interpret. As 
you have the utmost confidence in your primary care doctor, we 
shall leave this decision up to him and you. You will need 
recheck labs to be drawn on ___ to make sure things are going 
in the right direction.

We also noticed that you were not on an aspirin or a statin 
despite your reported history of a heart attack, peripheral 
vascular disease, and recurrent episodes of mesenteric ischemia. 
We and the vascular surgeons think that you would benefit from 
an aspirin and statin, hence we restarted these at discharge.

Please take care, we wish you the very best!

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

___:  chest x-ray:

No acute cardiopulmonary process

___:  liver/gallbladder US:

Thickened, edematous, hyperemic gallbladder wall associated with 

cholelithiasis is compatible with acute cholecystitis.  Given 
the absence of right upper quadrant pain, a HIDA scan or CT may 
be useful.

___:  CTA abdomen and pelvis:

.  Gallbladder wall edema, hyperemia, and cholelithiasis are 
highly 
concerning for cholecystitis.  Despite the clinical absence of 
right upper quadrant pain, there is no other obvious explanation 
for the CT findings.  If uncertainty remains, a HIDA scan may be 
useful for confirmation. 
  
2.  Note that the preliminary report described concern for 
cholangitis based on CBD wall enhancment.  However, the duct is 
not dilated.  Nor is there any pancreatic duct dilation to 
indicate obstruction at the level of the ampula.   
  
2.  Stable occlusion of the celiac origin and SMA and ___ 
stents.  Bifurcated super celiac aortic graft bypasses the SMA 
and occluded celiac.  There is a stable high-grade stenosis at 
the anastomosis of the graft with common hepatic artery but the 
common hepatic arterial tree is well perfused. 

___:  MRI of the abdomen:

1. Cholelithiasis with pericholecystic fluid surrounding the 
gallbladder and mild hyperemia within the adjacent hepatic 
parenchyma.  While the gallbladder is not significantly 
distended the appearances are suspicious for cholecystitis; a 
HIDA scan can be obtained for further assessment.   
  
2. Supraceliac graft, assessment of the upper abdominal arterial 
anatomy is limited by motion and metallic artifact and better 
visualized on the recent CT.   
  
3. Adrenal adenomata within the left adrenal gland, unchanged in 
size from the CT of ___. 
  
4. No evidence of choledocholithiasis or biliary dilatation. 

___:  gallbladder scan:

Normal hepatobiliary scan. 
  

  

   
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with vomitting and 
abdominal pain.  Upon admission, she was made NPO, given 
intravenous fluids, placed on unasyn and underwent imaging. She 
was noted on blood work to have mild elevations of the liver 
function tests.  Because of her presenting symptoms, she 
underwent an ultra-sound of the gallbladder and liver which 
showed numerous small stones in the neck of the gallbladder with 
a thickened gallbladder wall. Despite these findings, she was 
not tender on  examination.  The patient was placed on bowel 
rest and underwent serial abdominal examinations. The white 
blood cell count and liver function tests were closely 
monitored.  On HD #2, the patient underwent a cat scan of the 
abdomen which showed a distended hyperemic gallbladder with wall 
edema and pericholecystic fluid. Small gallstones were seen 
layering in the fundus. These findings were concerning for  
cholangitis and cholecystitis. For further investigation of the 
biliary tree, an MRI was obtained to investigate for biliary 
stones. Stones and sludge were seen in the gallbladder.  A 
gallbladder scan was done which was normal. With normal findings 
on imaging, the patient resumed a regular diet. On HD #5, she 
was discharged home in stable condition.  Her white blood cell 
count and liver enzymes were normalizing.  An appointment for 
follow-up was made with the acute care service and with her 
primary care provider.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ___ with c/o  ___ bowel 
movements of dark black stool per day.She underwent CTA of abd 
and pelvis which was suggestive of ileitis/colitis which could 
be ischemic, inflammatory, and/or infectious. She received 2 
more units of prbcs for low HCT and IV pantoprazole was started. 
Subsequently, she underwent a colonoscopy which showed changes 
consistent with colitis. While the biopsy did not show classic 
changes of ischemia, the appearance
during your colonoscopy was suggestive of ischemic colitis.
Her diet was advanced to clears  and then a regular diet which 
she tolerated well.TPN was weaned off,tube feeds were started 
along with calorie counts on po feeds.Her tube feeds were 
subsequently d/ced as she was taking adequate amounts of po 
feeds.On the day of discharge the patient was tolerating a 
regular diet, having no abdominal pain, passing non melanotic 
stools,having stable HCT and ambulating independently. She will 
follow up with Dr ___ on the ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission, pt was hydrated and followed with serial labs and 
exams. A CTA revealed that her aorto-CHA/SMA bypass was open. 
She received 3 units of pRBCs and 1 unit of FFP. Her lactate 
normalized and her N/V improved. She did have melenic stool and 
was thus started on a PPI. The following day, pt vomited 200cc 
of coffee ground emesis. She was given 2 units of pRBCs and 1 
unit of FFP. On HD3, pt again had melenic stools. Her Foley 
catheter was d/c'd. She was started on Ensure supplements. On 
HD4, d/t persistent inability to tolerate po intake, a Dobhoff 
was placed and tube feeds started. On HD5, reglan was started 
for high TF residuals. On HD6, pt had one episode of emesis. On 
HD7, pt's nausea and pain improved. She was given 2 units of 
pRBCs. On HD8, pt was tolerating TFs at goal. On HD9, TFs were 
decreased due to a high residual. A CT scan was done to look for 
a mechanical reason for perisistent nausea and abdominal pain 
and demonstrated findings concerning for cholecystitis. On HD10, 
after an ultrasound also demonstrated findings consistent with 
cholecystitis, pt had a HIDA scan with nonfilling of the 
gallbladder. On HD11, a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was 
placed and pt was started on Unasyn. Bile was sent for culture 
and subsequently grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. After placement of 
the perc chole, TFs were resumed. On HD12, pt again was able to 
tolerate TFs at goal. On HD13, TFs were cycled. On HD14, unasyn 
was switched to augmentin. On HD15, TFs were halved in an 
attempt to increase pt's appetite and po intake.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman
with history of MI, PVD, mesenteric ischemia s/p SMA bypass and
multiple revascularizations (most recently s/p exlap and SMA
thrombectomy) on Coumadin, who is presenting with
fatigue/weakness x10 days and painless hematuria x7 days in the
setting of taking extra Warfarin - found to have an INR of 14.1.

Ms. ___ states that ~10 days ago she "felt like [I] was
getting the flu" in terms of becoming very fatigued and
developing a cough. She then noticed that for the past 7 days,
she felt much more disoriented and had having increasing memory
loss during during the night (for example, pt notes that her
partner would give her Warfarin at night, but then she would 
wake
up in the middle of the night and believe that she had not taken
her Warfarin and take another dose - she is unsure how many 
extra
doses of warfarin she took). She notes that around this time, 
she
also developed lightheadedness and hematuria as well. States 
that
her INR was last checked ___ weeks ago and was ~3.8, however 
w/o
change in Warfarin dosing at that time.

She also notes that she was treated for a UTI ~2 weeks ago
(unsure of the antibiotic) as she had developed dysuria and
increased urgency (however no increased frequency) - states that
all of her symptoms resolved with treatment. She states that ~3
days ago she noticed blood clots in her urine, however denied 
any
difficulty with urination.  Around this same time she has
redeveloped increased urinary urgency (denies increased 
frequency
or dysuria though). 

Overall, she believes that during the past week she has started
getting better (particularly in terms of her memory). She denies
any preceding head strikes or LOC, however does note that within
the past week or so she fell while getting out of bed ("my legs
went out") and hit her R leg on the closet - again denied 
hitting
her head or LOC. Denies recent HAs, change in vision, dysphagia,
difficulty speaking, new limb weakness or difficulty walking. 

She also denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, chest
discomfort (does endorse her usual "reflux" symptoms though),
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, 
melena,
hematochezia, or hematemesis.

Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF SUMMARY
=============
___ w/ a history of chronic mesenteric ischemia (s/p multiple 
revascularizations, c/b SMA thrombosis, on warfarin), MI, and 
PVD who presented with hematuria, weakness (s/p fall), and 
confusion, found to have a supratherapeutic INR due to taking 
too many doses of warfarin as well as a UTI.

ACTIVE ISSUES
============
#) SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR
#) HISTORY OF MESENTERIC ISCHEMIA (s/p multiple 
revascularizations)
Patient presented with hematuria and found to have anemia and a 
supratherapeutic INR of 14.1 in the setting of taking extra 
warfarin.  On admission, warfarin held and given IV vitamin K. 
INR normalized to 1.5 but slowly uptrended again to 6.2. IV 
vitamin K given again, and INR normalized but then slowly began 
uptrending once again. Now s/p PO vitamin K 5mg x3 days 
(___) and INR has normalized to 1.1. Hematologic workup 
did not reveal any underlying coagulopathy. Specifically, 
inhibitor screen was negative, Factor VII wnl making ___ 
___ disease unlikely ___ panel still 
pending], DIC deemed unlikely given normal PTT and no 
schistocytes seen on blood smear. Given patient's INR responded 
to administration of vitamin K, etiology of supratherapeutic INR 
thought to be due to vitamin K deficiency compounded with 
warfarin overdose. Given this is the patient's second 
hospitalization due to bleeding from a supratherapeutic INR, we 
transitioned the patient from warfarin to rivaroxaban 20mg 
daily. We discussed this switch with the patient's vascular 
surgeon, Dr. ___, who was in agreement with this 
decision.

#) HEMATURIA
Presented with gross hematuria in the setting of 
supratherapeutic INR.  CBI placed on presentation given concern 
for clotting. Hematuria improved within one day of presentation 
and foley removed. Repeat UA (sent due to patient's report of 
dysuria) demonstrated persistent microscopic hematuria. Patient 
will need cystoscopy as an outpatient to rule out malignancy, 
especially given her older age and long history of smoking.

#) ANEMIA (ACUTE ON CHRONIC)
Baseline hemoglobin ~9, however previously normocytic. Acute 
anemia likely due to hematuria. Patient has past hx of GIB but 
she was guaiac negative x2. Found to have B12 deficiency 
(low-normal B12 but has elevated methylmalonic acid levels), 
possibly ___ pernicious anemia vs. damage to parietal 
cells/inability to produce intrinsic factor due to damage from 
her chronic mesenteric ischemia. Reticulocyte index was  
inappropriately low on admission but improved from 0.11 to 0.76. 
Gammaglobulinemia as cause of bone marrow suppression unlikely 
given normal gamma gap (Total protein minus albumin). 
Interestingly, her albumin is low (2.4) but she does not look 
malnourished. She is HIV negative. She was started on oral B12. 
She will need a workup for pernicious anemia as an outpatient.

#) ___
Found to have acute kidney injury on admission (0.9, up from 
baseline of 0.4).  Likely secondary to pre-renal azotemia in the 
setting of hematuria.  Given IVF and resolved with Cr 0.6 by 
discharge.  

#) UTI
#) TOXIC METABOLIC ENCEPHALOPATHY
Patient reported dysuria on admission and had altered mental 
status. Urine cultures showed E. Coli. Treated with ceftriaxone 
x5 days. Patient had vaginal irritation/dysuria after this 
antibiotic course but repeat UA and urine cultures were 
negative. Mental status improved very quickly after UTI 
treatment was initiated and she was fully alert and attentive by 
the time of discharge.

#) VAGINAL IRRITATION
Developed vaginal irritation after being treated for UTI. We 
treated for a presumed yeast infection, and her symptoms 
improving with miconazole nitrate vaginal cream (plan for 
treatment for 7 days, last day ___.

#) WEAKNESS, FALL
ORTHOSTASIS
Weakness and fall likely secondary to symptomatic anemia and 
toxic metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of UTI.  Evaluated 
by ___, determined safe to be discharged to home. However, 
patient found to be orthostatic throughout admission. Patient 
given IVF and encouraged to drink more fluids but remained 
orthostatic. Etiology remains unknown. Diabetes mellitus ruled 
out as a cause of her orthostasis(A1c 5.0). Started on 
fludrocortisone. Patient will need work-up for autonomic 
dysfunction as an outpatient.

#) CONSTIPATION
Patient did not have a bowel movement for several days. Started 
on Miralax.

#) THRUSH
Patient presented with thrush. Inciting cause unclear. Treated 
with nystatin oral suspension. 

CHRONIC ISSUES
==============
#) CAD, PVD
Patient was not on an aspirin or atorvastatin for unclear 
reasons. Started on both aspirin and atorvastatin. Should be 
considered for beta blocker treatment as an outpatient.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
==========================================
1) Patient needs cystoscopy as an outpatient to rule out bladder 
malignancy given hematuria, older age, and extensive smoking 
history
2) Patient needs screening colonoscopy in ___ (last 
colonoscopy ___ with recommended repeat ___. Stool was 
guaiac negative x2 during this hospitalization.
3) Patient started on aspirin 81mg daily and atorvastatin 40mg

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the hospital and made NPO after initial 
CT scan showed no signs of worsening mesenteric ischemia. She 
was started on IV fluids and given a bowel regimen which 
improved her abdominal pain. Her LFTs were normal and she was 
without leukocytosis. She did initially have an elevated 
lactate, however and so this was trended and came down without 
intervention. Her abdominal pain improved and her diet was 
advanced from clears to low residue diet. She had a PO contrast 
CT scan as well to look for signs of obstruction, which there 
were none. She was noted to have cholelithiasis and 3mm CBD 
stone but there was no ductal dilatation or perichilecystic 
fluid and her pain was not characteristic for GB etiology. On 
initially starting diet she had return of discomfort and was 
reluctant to continue with a diet. Although, her return of pain 
was not entirely clear as she mentioned it being pleuritic and 
also in her left chest. EKG at this time showed no change and 
her cardiac enzymes were negative x3. Her CXR also showed no 
signs of an acute process. She was again encouraged  to take a 
low residue diet, which she did well with after moving her 
bowels ___ more times. At time of discharge she only had a trace 
of abdominal discomfort on deep palpation that was thought to be 
probably be her baseline for now. she was tolerating a regualr 
diet, ambulating, and voiding without issue. She was discharged 
on ASA 325 ___s Senna/Colace.
