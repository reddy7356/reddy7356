operating room; please see the operative note for details.  Pt 
was extubated, taken to the PACU until stable, then transferred 
to the ward for observation. 

Neuro: The patient was alert and oriented throughout 
hospitalization; pain was initially managed with a Dilaudid PCA 
and IV acetaminophen and then transitioned to oral oxycodone and 
acetaminophen as well as IV hydromorphone as needed for pain. 
CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.
Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Good pulmonary 
toilet, early ambulation and incentive spirometry were 
encouraged throughout hospitalization. 
GI/GU/FEN: The patient was initially kept NPO with a 
___ tube in place for decompression.  On ___, 
the NGT was removed. Subsequently, the diet was advanced 
sequentially to a regular diet, which was well tolerated. A 
swallow study done on ___ showed no evidence of leak or 
obstruction from the esophagus to proximal small bowel. 
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored. Indwelling 
catheter was removed on POD2 (___). A JP drain was placed 
intra-operatively. Outputs were serosanguinous throughout the 
hospitalization course, with no evidence of amylase leak. The JP 
drain was removed on *****. 
ID: The patient's fever curves were closely watched for signs of 
infection, of which there were none.
HEME: Perioperatively, the patient's platelets trended downward 
with a nadir of 77 on ___. SC heparin and IV famotidine 
were discontinued. Heparin dependent antibodies were found to be 
negative, and SC heparin was re-started. 
Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and ___ 
dyne boots were used during this stay and was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible.
Pathology: The pathology report from the total gastrectomy 
showed pT4aN3a (tumor invading serosa and affecting ___ 
perigastric nodes) gastric adenocarcinoma, with negative 
proximal and distal margins and extensive lymphatic invasion. 

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
and hemodynamically stable.  The patient was tolerating a diet,

increased to 930 ___s bilirubin being elevated to 3.4. His
most recent LFTs few weeks ago were fairly normal. It was 
unclear
if this was related to his new immunotherapy ordered this could
be related to obstructive jaundice from the malignancy. He was

IMAGING AND STUDIES
___ PTBD:
FINDINGS: 
1.  Moderate right intrahepatic biliary dilatation and common 
bile duct
dilatation secondary to low CBD obstruction.  Cone beam CT 
confirms moderate right anterior intrahepatic biliary duct 
dilatation with paucity of biliary ducts in the right posterior 
and left biliary system secondary to hepatic metastases.  
Catheterization of the segment 2 biliary ducts demonstrates mild 
dilatation peripherally with long segment stricturing secondary 
to central hepatic metastasis.  Based on the findings the 
decision was made not to obtain left biliary duct access.
IMPRESSION: 
Successful placement of the right anterior ___ internal-external 
biliary
drain.

___ BILIARY STENT:
FINDINGS:
1. Right 10 ___ percutaneous transhepatic internal external 
biliary
drainage catheters.
2. Cholangiogram showing distal CBD obstruction.  Post stent 
deployment and
cholangioplasty demonstrates brisk antegrade flow of contrast 
into the
duodenum through the common bile duct stent.
3. Successful exchange of right 10 ___ percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary
internal external drainage catheters with new 10 ___ anchor 
drain.

___ CT AP:
IMPRESSION:
1. Infiltrative soft tissue mass encasing the remnant stomach 
extending along the gastrohepatic ligament to the hepatic hilum 
and involving the celiac axis, portal vein, SMV, splenic vein 
and pancreas as detailed above consistent with invasive local 
disease recurrence.
2. Significant interval progression of hepatic metastases as 
described.  In
particular, there is diffuse metastatic infiltration in the left 
lobe with
occlusion of the lateral branch of the left portal vein and 
distal branches of the left hepatic vein.
3. New 1.3 cm hyperattenuating focus within the right hepatic 
lobe along the periphery of the large hepatic lesion suspicious 
for a focal bleed versus pseudoaneurysm.  Further evaluation 
with a multiphasic CT scan of the abdomen is recommended.
4. 2.5 cm nodule in the region of the left adrenal gland is 
suspicious for
left adrenal metastasis.
5. Multiple peritoneal and omental nodules as described are 
consistent with
peritoneal carcinomatosis.
6. Enlarged retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes 
consistent with
metastatic lymphadenopathy.
7. Splenic infarct from tumor involvement of the splenic artery.
8. New nodular and ill-defined opacities in the visualized lower 
lung fields concerning for metastatic involvement although 
superimposed infectious etiologies could also be considered.

___ CHOLANGIOGRAM:
1. Right 10 ___ external percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage
catheter.
2. Cholangiogram showing patent common bile duct stent with 
brisk antegrade
flow.  No biliary ductal dilatation.
3. Successful removal of right 10 ___ external percutaneous 
transhepatic
biliary drainage catheter with embolization of tract.
 
 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with metastatic HER-2 
negative gastric adenocarcinoma s/p neoadjuvant ECF and then EOX 
___ followed by gastrectomy/Roux-en-Y in ___ recently initiated on nivolumab early ___, 
who presented with nausea, acute on chronic abdominal pain, and 
LFTs markedly above baseline secondary to metastatic CBD 
obstruction and worsening of disease burden. After discussions 
with the patient, his wife and his niece, patient is CMO and 
DNR/DNI.

#Acute on chronic abdominal pain
#Nausea
#Hiccups
Patient has chronic abdominal pain and nausea from his 
underlying metastatic malignancy. His pain and nausea were not 
well controlled at home, and worsened with spread of his 
disease. Initially there was hope that biliary 
decompression/drainage would help his symptoms, but this was not 
the case. Palliative care was consulted for symptom management. 
He was on Zofran, metoclopramide, Ativan, morphine pca, 
oxycodone and methadone. He was discharged to a hospice center 
to focus on pain and symptom management.

#Goals of care
On ___ patient expressed that he wants to focus on being 
comfortable, and not undergo aggressive care because it will not 
make the cancer better and not help his pain. He asks to be 
comfortable, and he and family explicitly do not want lab draws, 
imaging or anything that is not going to improve comfort. 
Palliative care was consulted during his hospitalization for 
symptom management. He was discharged to hospice.

#Obstructive jaundice:
#Metastatic gastric cancer:
Patient is followed by Dr. ___. He presented as a 
transfer from ___ with elevated LFTs/AP/T bili along with 
imaging consistent with common bile duct obstruction from 
metastatic disease. Imaging also showed worsening 
intra-abdominal metastases. Patient underwent cholangiogram with 
PTBD placement on ___, with repeat cholangiogram on ___ with 
CBD stent placed. Then on ___ right anchor drain was removed 
and tract was emblazed. Labs initially improved with PTBD done 
___, then uptrended and then remained stable. Palliative care 
was consulted for symptom control as above. Dr. ___ was 
updated during his hospital stay. 

#Leukocytosis
Uptrended his last week of hospitalization, without increase in 
LFTs, other focal symptoms or fevers. Differential included 
infection vs worsening metastatic disease. No intervention was 
done as patient was transitioned to CMO.

#Severe malnutrition
Patient underwent J-tube placement for tubefeeds, but also so 
pain medications could be given with less nausea. Tube feeds 
were stopped when transitioned to CMO, out of concern that they 
may precipitate pain or nausea.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
#Patient comfort measures only at discharge

of breath. He was found to be anemic. His H&H in ___ was 
9.6/29.8. Previously in ___, his H&H was 14.9/44.8. The 
culprit of his anemia was believed to be secondary to high dose 
NSAID use. He had been taking ibuprofen or aleve two times a day

imaging:
-------

___ CT Ab/P
1.  No CT evidence for small bowel mass.  Given that proximal 
loops of small
bowel are collapsed, correlation with capsule endoscopy results 
is recommended
as CT is insensitive for small, small bowel lesions.  
2.  Filling defects persist within subsegmental vascular 
branches of the
bilateral lower lobes, likely due to pulmonary emboli.  
Dedicated chest CT
examination could be performed for more complete assessment of 
extent of
thrombus.

___ Ab XR
1.  Capsule projecting over the right mid lateral abdomen, 
likely within the
ascending colon.  No evidence of bowel obstruction.

___ ballon endoscopy:
1. Erythema in stomach
2. Delayed gastric emptying
3. Lymphangiectasia in small bowel
4. ___ small ileal angioectasias (nonbleeding)

___ CT Ab/P
1.  Small bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli in the lower 
lobes.  No evidence of right heart strain.  
2.  No active extravasation of contrast within the small bowel 
and colon to suggest active bleeding.  
3.  Left renal cyst.  
4.  Small hydrocele.  

___ colonoscopy:
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Fresh blood was noted throughout the colon and into the terminal 
ileum. No active source of bleeding was identified. Highly 
suspicious though for a small bowel lesion.
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and 15cm into terminal 
ileum

___ EGD: 
Normal esophagus.
Normal stomach.
Normal duodenum.

 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M w/ hx of iron deficiency anemia orginally attributed to 
chronic NSAID use admitted after colonoscopy showed fresh blood 
in the colon into the terminal ileum suspicious for small bowel 
lesion.

# Gastrointestinal bleeding, NOS- CTA was unsuccesful at 
localization of source of bright red blood. He then underwent 
capsule endoscopy which revealed gastritis, delayed gastric 
emptying and  ileal angioectasias which may have been the source 
of his bleeding. Since the capsule ran out of battery before 
traversing his entire intestine, he underwent CT abdomen which 
was unrevealing for any source of bleeding. His H&H was trended 
and was stable and he had no episodes of hematochezia or melena 
during his hospitalization. He was started on a PPI twice daily. 


# H. pylori infection - Started on triple therapy with a PPI, 
clarithromycin, and amoxicilin.

# Pulmonary embolism - Likely source of pts SOB and unilateral 
leg swelling that prompted presentation to ___. Unprovoked 
in the absence of risk factors including recent immobilization, 
long travel with prolonged periods of being sedentary. PE was 
noted incidentally on CTA done to evaluate bleeding source. He 
was started on a heparin drip and then transitioned to lovenox.  
His H/H remained stable while on anticoagulation. He was also 
started on coumadin. He will follow up with his PCP who will 
manage his anti-coagulation. 

# Iron deficiency anemia - Likely from GIB, continued on iron 
pills.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

It was a pleasure taking care of you at the ___ 
___. You were admitted because during your 
outpatient colonoscopy and EGD, you were found to have blood in 
your intestines. Out of concern for an acute bleed from your 
gastrointestinal tract, you were brought to the hospital for 
further evaluation. We had the GI team see you who recommended 
capsule endoscopy - this entailed swallowing a camera to get a 
look at your intestines. This revealed AVMs (arteriovenous 
malformations - or abnormal connections between your arteries 
and veins) in your intestines. AVMs are common sources of 
bleeding. 

Also, while you were here, you underwent a CT scan in an attempt 
to localize the source of your bleeding. This CT scan found 
bilateral blood clots in your lungs. These blood clots are 
called pulmonary emboli. They are likely contributing to your 
shortness of breath. We started to anticoagulate you (meaning we 
thinned your blood) as a treatment to prevent more clots from 
forming and to dissolve the ones that are present. You will do 
shots of lovenox while taking coumadin until your INR is in the 
appropriate range. Your goal INR will be between ___.

You were also started on antibiotics for a stomach infection 
called H. pylori. You will take these for a total of 10-days.

It is extremely important to follow up with your Primary Care 
Doctor ___ see below for upcoming appointments).
