History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with history of mitral 
regurgitation followed with serial echocardiograms since ___. 
His last several echocardiograms revealed moderate to severe 
mitral regurgitation with bi-leaflet prolapse. Left ventricular 
function remained normal with left ventricular cavity size top
normal/borderline dilated. A Cardiac MRI in ___ 
demonstrated partial posterior leaflet flail, dilated left 
ventricular cavity size ___ 6.7cm), normal systolic function, 
and moderately reduced forward effective LVEF. His most recent 
echocardiogram on ___ demonstrated moderate to severe 
mitral regurgitation and moderate to severe bi-leaflet mitral 
valve prolapse. Given the slight increase in his left 
ventricular cavity size, he was referred to Dr. ___ 
surgical consultation. He is very active at baseline. He plays 
tennis twice a week, golfs once a week, and walks regularly. He 
has denied any changes in his exercise tolerance. He did not an 
episode of dizziness last week. He otherwise denied syncope,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted on ___ and was taken to the 
operating room. He underwent mitral valve repair with resection 
of the middle scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2) and a mitral 
valve annuloplasty with a 32 ___ annuloplasty band. 
Please see operative note for full details. He tolerated the 
procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. 
  
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1.  Beta blocker was initiated and he was 
diuresed toward his preoperative weight. He remained 
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery.  He was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  He 
did not tolerate Metoprolol due to hypotension. 
By the time of discharge on POD 4 he was ambulating freely, the 
wound was healing, and pain was controlled with oral analgesics. 
He was discharged home in good condition with appropriate follow 
up instructions.
