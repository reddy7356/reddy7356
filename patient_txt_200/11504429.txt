evaluation of chest pain, found to have positive stress test.

# Coronary artery disease: Patient presented with chest pain and 
negative trops ___ yet still had positive stress test and culprit 
lesion noted in RCA. She was taken to cath and found to have 
severe RCA disease with moderate LAD disease. DES was placed in 
the RCA. She was started on aspirin and Plavix to be continued 
for ___ year minimum. Her statin was switched to atorvastatin 80mg 
and the reminder of her home medications were continued.  

# Diabetes mellitus: Patient with history of DM, on insulin 
sliding scale in house and discharged on home metformin. 

# GERD: Patient was on pantoprazole 40 mg bid dosing, likely 
secondary to her complaint that her chest pain got worse with 
food. Found to have ischemic disease and discharged on 
omeprazole 20mg daily. Consider down titrating this as 
outpatient.

# HTN: Continued home valsartan and HCTZ but upon restarting was 
hypokalemic so HCTZ was reduced to valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide 
160-12.5 mg. Please follow up BP upon discharge. Consider beta 
blocker as outpatient for further cardio-protection. 

# Hypokalemia: patient with history of hypokalemia, was 
hypokalemic post cath to 2.9. Patient remained asymptomatic and 
was repleated. Possibly secondary to HCTZ, decreased to 12.5 
upon discharge. Please follow up and consider changing 
antihypertensive if not tolerant. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
# Discharged on new clopidogrel and changed from pantoprazole to 
omeprazole 
# Please follow-up potassium levels and BP now that HCTZ has 
been decreased
# Outpatient cardiologist to please provide referral for 
outpatient cardiac rehab
# Follow up incidental left thyroid nodule found on CTA.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure caring for you here at ___ 
___. You came to us for cardiac catheterization after 
experiencing chest pain that radiated to your back and jaw. You 
were found to have a blockage in one of your arteries and got a 
stent placed to open it. You were placed on a few new 
medications and should take them as prescribed below. 

We decreased the dose of your hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, 
because we were concerned that it was leading to recurrent low 
potassium levels. You should follow-up with your primary care 
provider this week to check your electrolyte panel and make sure 
your potassium is okay, and to check your blood pressure since 
we changed this medication. 

You also need to establish care with a Cardiologist. You should 
follow-up with a new cardiologist within ___ weeks of discharge. 
They can help set you up for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation.

Thank you for choosing ___ for your healthcare needs.
Sincerely,
Your ___ Team

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ year-old R-handed woman with PMHx of DM2, HTN,
prior TIA and vertigo who presents with vertigo and a black area
in her R lateral visual field. She reports that this morning she
woke up and had vertigo with a sensation of the room spinning. 
She doesn't know it it was spinning right or left, but looking 
up
was "the worst". When she first got it, she noticed that the 
room
was spinning but that her vision was cloudy and then went black
in both eyes and she "couldn't see".  This lasted for less than 
1
minute, and then when it stopped she felt like there was a black
circle in her R lateral field of vision "like a fly".  When 
asked
to explain it more she reported it was like an "eye, grey on the
outside and then black on the inside in a circle".  This did not
go away all day, but she got a cold compress and put it on her
head and took meclizine and after 30 minutes her vertigo
improved.  Of note, she has had episodes of vertigo for the last
___ years, and they usually occur when she wakes up, improve over 
30
mins with melizine and are worse when she looks up.  She doesn't
have nausea or vomiting with them and she does have some mild
unsteadiness walking.  Today's episode was like her prior
episodes, but the vertigo was more severe and the visual deficit
was new.  She has never had any visual issue like she has had
today in the past or with her episodes of vertigo.  She came to
the ED when she felt unwell at work.  In the ED, she got a NCHCT
which showed no no acute issues.  She was admitted for further
workup of possible stroke.   
 
On neuro ROS, the pt reports that her vertigo is improved, but
still c/o a black spot in her R lateral vision, denies headache,
blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, 
lightheadedness,
tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties producing or
comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness, numbness,
parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or retention.
Denies difficulty with gait.
 
On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation 
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented with vertigo, transient blurry vision and 
right visual field obscurations. She had a NCHCT and CTA head 
and neck performed in the ED, which did not show any acute 
process or arterial stenosis, thrombosis or dissection. As the 
main consideration is the possibility of a vertebral/PCA infarct 
given the vertigo and report of right visual field obscuration, 
she was admitted to the Neurology service for MRI. Her vertigo 
improved with Meclizine. Her neurologic exam was nonfocal and 
notably she had full visual fields to color field confrontation 
testing. She had an MRI of her head, which showed no masses, 
infarcts, or hemorrhage.

In addition, her CTA showed an enlarged nodular thyroid, she 
will need an outpatient ultrasound for further evaluation of 
this.
