History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ old male without significant past medical 
history who presented to the ED after LSD intoxication.

The patient was found the day prior to admission  naked, 
agitated, and running around ___ by the police and EMS. 
When he arrived in the ED, handcuffed to a stretcher, he was 
agitated and communicative, but confused, and unable to give a 
history. It was noted that he was repeatedly biting his 
bilateral forearms.

In the ED, exam was significant for tachycardia to the 160s, 
tachypnea, and abrasions over the body and head with erythema 
and tenseness of the bilateral forearms.  Labs were significant 
for likely ___ with Cr 1.7, lactate elevation to 7.1, mild 
transaminitis, elevated CK to >3000, and leukocytosis to 24. 
Stox/Utox positive only for benzos. CT of the head C-spine did 
not reveal any acute injury. X-ray of the left wrist, was 
indicative of soft tissue swelling but negative for fracture. 
The patient was put in four-point constraints, received two 
doses of IM midazolam for agitation and 3L IV fluids for 
presumed rhabdomyolysis, and was started on vancomycin IV for 
cellulitis.

Over the course of several hours, patient rapidly returned to 
baseline mental status. He became much more alert, interactive, 
calm, and restraints were discontinued. He endorsed, at this 
time, taking LSD without any other drugs; no PCP, ___, 
cocaine, ethanol.  He was admitted to medicine for management of 
rhabdomyolysis and cellulitis.

On the floor, the patient endorses the history above. He denies 
pain in the upper extremities other than when he moves around. 
He was started on Unasyn and maintained on IV fluids. Hand 
surgery was consulted for concern for rapidly spreading 
cellulitis and possible compartment syndrome.

IMAGING
====================
Non-con head Ct ___ IMPRESSION:
1. Normal study.

CT C-spine ___ FINDINGS: 
Alignment is normal. No fractures are identified.  There is no 
evidence of
spinal canal or neural foraminal stenosis. There is no 
prevertebral soft
tissue swelling. There is no evidence of infection or neoplasm.
IMPRESSION: Normal study

Left upper extremity x-ray ___ IMPRESSION:  
No fracture. Soft tissue swelling without visualized fracture or 
radiopaque foreign body.

Left forearm ultrasound ___ IMPRESSION: 
There is edematous appearance of the subcutaneous tissues of the 
left forearm.
No evidence of drainable fluid collection concerning for 
abscess.

Renal US ___ IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.  Trace 
perinephric fluid and loss of normal
corticomedullary differentiation bilaterally consistent with the 
history of acute renal injury.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ old male with no significant medical history who 
presented with LSD intoxication and was found to have upper 
extremity cellulitis, rhabomyolysis, and ___. Patient was 
brought in by police acutely intoxicated and agitated after LSD 
use. Agitation resolved rapidly, but lab tests showed ___ with 
Cr peaking at 3.5 and CK peaking >9000. Patient was evaluated by 
the nephrology team, and received aggressive IV hydration, and 
kidney injury improved. Was also treated for LUE cellulitis that 
was thought to be precipitated by self-inflicted bite wounds 
with clindamycin; he remained afebrile and hemodynamically 
stable throughout admission, and initial leukocytosis 
downtrended. Due to fluid overload after aggressive IV 
resuscitation, patient was also given low-dose Lasix to 
accelerate diuresis.

___: 
#Rhabdomyolysis: CPK peaked >9000 in the setting of dehydration 
and exercise during LSD intoxication. Accompanied by kidney 
injury with Cr peaking at 3.5 from unknown baseline (admission 
Cr 1.7). UA showed moderate blood with few RBCs and no casts to 
suggest ATN; renal US was without obstruction. Renal service was 
consulted and recommended aggressive IV hydration. No profound 
electrolyte abnormalities were noted during admission. Initial 
concern for compartment syndrome of left upper extremity given 
high CK and circumferential erythema of left arm, but hand 
surgery team felt presentation was most consistent with 
cellulitis. On discharge, CK had downtrended to ~1100 and Cr was 
2.2. 

#Volume overload: Noted in the face and upper extremities in the 
setting of fluid resuscitation for rhabdomyolysis. Patient was 
given furosemide 20 mg IV x1 and 20 mg PO x1 prior to discharge 
to accelerate diuresis. 

#Cellulitis: Patient had left forearm large abrasion with 
well-demarcated forearm, wrist, hand swelling and erythema 
surrounding self-inflicted bite marks, consistent with 
cellulitis. US was negative for infectious collection, and hand 
surgery was consulted and felt that there was low concern for 
invasive infection or compartment syndrome. Patient was treated 
initially with vancomycin and unasyn which was narrowed to PO 
clindamycin. Initial leukocytosis to 24 downtrended to normal 
during admission. Patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically 
stable. Patient will finish 7 day course of antibiotics on ___

Transitional Issues:
[] Discharge Cr 2.2. Patient should have labs repeated on ___ 
to document continued kidney injury improvement. 
[] Continue PO clindamycin for 7 day course for cellulitis 
though ___.
[] Patient should have nephrology follow-up for ___ secondary to 
rhabdomyolysis.
[] Continue to address illicit drug use and consider outpatient 
social work involvement.
[] The patient had significant increase in weight from IVF and 
was urinating well on the day of discharge with improvement of 
his swelling. Please follow up with his anasarca and consider 
Lasix for further diuresis as needed.
[] The patient has a significant abrasion in the left arm which 
was healing well on the day of discharge but still require 
further dressing and personal wound care. Please assess healing 
of the abrasion.
