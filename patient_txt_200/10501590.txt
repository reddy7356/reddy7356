RADIOLOGY:
==========
CTA ___:
CT Thorax:  The airways are patent to the subsegmental level.  
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph node 
enlargement by CT size criteria.  The heart, pericardium, and 
great vessels are within normal limits.  No hiatal hernia seen.  
Lung windows demonstrate a 4 mm right upper lobe pulmonary 
nodule (2:33).  No additional pulmonary nodules seen. There is 
no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   
  
CTA Thorax:  The aorta and main thoracic vessels are well 
opacified.  The 
aorta demonstrates normal caliber throughout the thorax without 
intramural hematoma or dissection.  There is no filling defect 
to suggest pulmonary embolism.  Osseous structures: No blastic 
or lytic lesions suspicious for malignancy.  
  
Although this study is not designed for assessment of 
intra-abdominal 
structures, the visualized solid organs and stomach are 
unremarkable.   
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or pneumonia.  
  
2. 4mm right upper lobe pulmonary nodule. If no risk factors for 
malignancy, including history of smoking, then no additional 
follow-up needed. If risk factors then follow-up chest CT in ___ 
year is recommended.  

RUQ WITH DOPPLERS ___:
FINDINGS:  The liver is normal in size, echogenicity, and 
architecture.  There
is no focal liver lesion.  The gallbladder is normal and there 
are no stones
or sludge.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation and
the common bile duct measures 2 mm.  The pancreas is not well 
visualized. 
There is no ascites.
 
The main, left, and the right portal veins are patent with 
hepatopetal flow. 
The main, left, and right hepatic arteries are patent with sharp 
systolic
upstroke and antegrade diastolic flow.  The right, middle, and 
left hepatic
veins are patent with antegrade flow.
 
IMPRESSION:  Normal liver duplex ultrasound.

TotBili-0.___ anesthesiologist with history of sagittal venous sinus 
thrombosis in ___ presenting with two weeks of low grade fever, 
headache, night sweats, tachycardia, and tachypnea.
 
#  Fevers/Tachycardia/Tachypnea: Pt with two weeks of fevers and 
malaise as well as several days of tachycardia, tachypnea and 
dry cough, night sweats and headache. Pt had prescribed himself 
short course of levoflox for atypical pneumonia with no 
improvement of symptoms.  CTA in ED negative for PE or 
pneumonia. Pt found to have positive IgG and IgM CMV 
antibiodies, making CMV mononucelosis most likely diagnosis. CBC 
Differential significant for increased monocytes, most likely 
from CMV. Previous differential from ___ includes atypical 
lymphs. Although patient endorses cough and nightsweats and has 
a 4mm nodule seen on CT, he denies weight loss, denies 
hemoptisis, denies known exposure and does not have cavitary 
lesions making TB unlikely.  On discharge, his symptoms were 
improved. EBV and HIV testing pending on discharge
 
#  H/o sagittal venous sinus thrombosis: Pt is s/p thrombectomy 
after venous sinus thrombosis in ___. He was treated with 
riveroxiban for ___ years. He had followed up with hematology 
and neurology. No coagulation d/o was diagnosed. When pt began 
experiencing headaches as an outpatient, he prophylactically 
restarted rivaroxiban and stated his headaches improved. Denies 
vision changes, weakness, or seizures. Given lack of symptoms or 
focal neurological deficits on exam, no MRV was performed. Based 
on guidelines, pt's with sinus venous thrombosis without 
identified coagulation disorder should be anticogulated for 6 mo 
after event. Given pt's thrombosis was in ___, advised pt to 
stop rivaroxiban and follow up with his outpatient hematologist.

#  Transaminitis: Pt with mildly elevated LFTs which have 
uptrended since ___. Most likely mild viral hepatitis in setting 
of CMV infection. However, given his hx of thrombosis and 
possible coagulation d/o,a RUQ ultrasound was performed that 
showed no show evidence of thrombosis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Pt had HIV test to rule out immunocompromise given his CMV 
infection. This result was pending at discharge and should be 
follow up. EBV testing also pending
[ ] Based on guidelines, pt's with sinus venous thrombosis 
without identified coagulation disorder should be anticogulated 
for 6 mo after event. Given pt's thrombosis was in ___, advised 
pt to stop rivaroxiban and follow up with his outpatient 
hematologist
[ ] Pt had mild transaminits in setting of CMV infection, should 
have LFTs rechecked as an outpatient to monitor for improvement
[ ] 4mm nodule found on CT scan. Pt denies any risk factors such 
as smoking or hx of malignancy and per radiology recommendations 
does not need further imaging
