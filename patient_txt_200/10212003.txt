Brief Hospital Course:
___ G1P0 readmitted at 26w5d RLQ/flank pain.
.
Ms ___ was readmitted for persistent right sided abdominal 
pain and constipation. She remained afebrile and without 
evidence of infection. Since she was recently diagnosed with a 
small renal stone and subsequently was readmitted twice with 
persistent pain, urology was consulted. Urology recommended 
repeating an ultrasound, which revealed no evidence of distal 
ureteral stone, mild right hydronephrosis, no jets visible 
bilaterally but bladder noted to be increasing in size by end of 
exam. They felt that her presentation did not appear consistent 
with renal calculi, including her pain, no red blood cells in 
urine, and only physiologic hydronephrosis on ultrasound. 
Therefore, they did not feel that a stent was warranted. She 
contined to receive IV fluids and Dilaudid for pain control. She 
was on a bowel regimen due to her recent history of 
constipation, likely due to narcotic use. By hospital day 3, she 
continued to report intermittent right sided abdominal pain. She 
had a couple small bowel movements. GI was consulted at that 
time and they did not feel the etiology of her pain was GI 
related. For her constipation, they recommended avoiding 
narcotics and miralax as needed. On hospital day #4, Ms ___ 
pain had completely resolved. The etiology of her pain remained 
unclear, however, she was afebrile, tolerating a regular diet, 
and was painfree. She was discharged home and will have close 
outpatient followup.
.
Fetal testing remained reassuring. Ultrasound on ___ revealed a 
vertex fetus, BPP ___, AFI 15.5, and EFW 991g(48%).
