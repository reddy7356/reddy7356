Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with non-resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma s/p 
FOLFIRINOX with neutropenic fever. 

#. Neutropenic fever- Patient met SIRS criteria on admission for 
fever, tachypnea and tachycardia.  Her only localizing symptom 
was diarrhea which had been persistent for 1 week and which had 
a negative workup previous at OSH.  She was covered with 
Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl from ___ to ___.  She was given Neupogen 
and her counts recovered.  She was afebrile for 48 hours with 
cultures negative and neutropenia resolved and antibiotics were 
stopped without subsequent fevers.  She developed leukocytosis 
in the setting of having been administered Neupogen. 

# CV-r : Patient transferred to the ICU on ___ for new AFib 
with RVR and associated hemodynamic instability with SBPs in ___ 
after being given Metoprolol.  Electrical cardioversion was 
attempted and was unsuccessful. She was given IVF and started 
wtih amiodarone loading was begun on floor.  In the ICU, she was 
continued on amiodarone gtt. This resulted in rebound in blood 
pressure and restoration of SR on morning of transfer. 
Cardiology was consulted. They recommended continuing Amiodarone 
loading.  She was started on metoprolol 25 mg XL daily. Two sets 
of cardiac enzymes and TSH were WNL.  She may require an 
outpatient TTE and followup with cardiology.  Anticoagulation 
was deferred given prognosis with pancreatic cancer.  

# CV-p: Patient with e/o mild CHF in the setting of volume

Hold additional therapy pending resolution of above.  ___ switch 
to FOLFOX or Gem/Abraxane as outpt. 

#. Tinea pedis- terbinafine
 
#. HL- stopped home statin

#. GERD- PPI

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o F with a history of pancreatic CA, breast 
CA recent FOLFIRINOX ___ presenting with BRBPR. 

# Acute blood loss anemia secondary to a lower GI bleed: Ms. 
___ was admitted with hematochezia.  However, throughout this 
stay, her HCT remained stable, she had normal BUN/Creatinine, 
and originally described "not a lot of blood loss".  
Furthermore, there was no further GI bleed during this stay.  
Due to these factors, the bleeding was considered a small volume 
lower GI bleed. Serial Hct was stable on discharge.  Mult prior 
stool c.diff were neg; there was no evidence of hemorrhoids on 
exam; and the previous colonoscopy ___ yrs ago had no significant 
abnls that would account for more recent bleed 
(AVM/diverticulosis) which would warrant further evaluation.

treatment was postponed due to functional status. It is possible 
that she will be continued on gemcitibine, however a more recent 
___ was markedly elevated ___ (80,000) - given the concern 
of further expansion.  ___ oncology was involved and consulted. 
 A torso CT scan was attempted but unable to be performed d/t

It was a pleasure looking after you, Ms. ___.  As you know, 
you were admitted for blood in the stools.  You were observed

were no further episodes of bleeding.  Given that there was no 
reduction in blood count, a colonscopy was not performed.  
   To follow the status of the pancreatic cancer and due to 
elevated tumor markers, CT scan of the torso was attempted, but 
was forestalled due to concern of IV dye allergy reactions.  
This can be performed as an outpatient as needed.
