or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left 
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color 
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild 
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and 
inferolateral hypokinesis (EF 45-50%). Doppler parameters are 
most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular diastolic 
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is an anterior space which 
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

1. Please return to the emergency department or notify your 
physician if you experience any of the following: severe pain 
not relieved by medication, increased swelling, decreased 
sensation, difficulty with movement, fevers greater than 101.5, 
shaking chills, increasing redness or drainage from the incision 
site, chest pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns.
 
2. Please follow up with your primary physician regarding this 
admission and any new medications and refills. 
 
3. Resume your home medications unless otherwise instructed.
 
4. You have been given medications for pain control. Please do 
not drive, operate heavy machinery, or drink alcohol while 
taking these medications. As your pain decreases, take fewer 
tablets and increase the time between doses. This medication can 
cause constipation, so you should drink plenty of water daily 
and take a stool softener (such as Colace) as needed to prevent 
this side effect.  Call your surgeons office 3 days before you 
are out of medication so that it can be refilled.  These 
medications cannot be called into your pharmacy and must be 
picked up in the clinic or mailed to your house.  Please allow 
an extra 2 days if you would like your medication mailed to your 
home.
 
5. You may not drive a car until cleared to do so by your 
surgeon.
 
6. Please call your surgeon's office to schedule or confirm your 
follow-up appointment.
 
7. SWELLING: Ice the operative joint 20 minutes at a time, 
especially after activity or physical therapy. Do not place ice 
directly on the skin. You may wrap the knee with an ace bandage 
for added compression. Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs such as Celebrex, 
ibuprofen, Advil, Aleve, Motrin, naproxen etc).
 
8. ANTICOAGULATION: Please continue your Lovenox for four (4) 
weeks to help prevent deep vein thrombosis (blood clots).  If 
you were taking aspirin prior to your surgery, it is OK to 
continue at your previous dose while taking this medication. 
 
9. WOUND CARE: Please keep your incision clean and dry. It is 
okay to shower five days after surgery but no tub baths, 
swimming, or submerging your incision until after your four (4) 
week checkup. Please place a dry sterile dressing on the wound 
each day if there is drainage, otherwise leave it open to air. 
Check wound regularly for signs of infection such as redness or 
thick yellow drainage. Staples will be removed at your follow-up 
appointment in two weeks.
 
10. ___ (once at home): Home ___, dressing changes as 
instructed, wound checks.
 
11. ACTIVITY: Weight bearing as tolerated on the operative 
extremity. Mobilize.  ROM as tolerated. No strenuous exercise or 
heavy lifting until follow up appointment.

Physical Therapy:
WBAT RLE
ROMAT
Mobilize frequently
Wean from assistive devices when appropriate
Treatments Frequency:

FINDINGS: There is no acute cardiopulmonary process. There are 
degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine along with loss 
of vertebral body height at multiple levels, unchanged since the 
prior examination. 
.
Cardiac cath ___
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system 
revealed one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was 
normal. The LAD was a small vessel with mild disease. The 
mid-LCX had a 90% stenosis after OM3. The distal LCX had a 
40-50% stenosis. The proximal LCX stents were patent with mild 
instent restenosis. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mild systemic arterial 
hypertension with BP 145/63 mmHg. Left sided filling pressures 
were elevated with an LVEDP of 23 mmHg. There was no transaortic 
gradient on pullback of catheter from LV to aorta. 
3. Left ventriculography demonstrated hypokinesis of inferior LV 
wall with calculated LVEF of 50%. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. One vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Mild LV systolic dysfunction worse in the inferior LV wall. 
3. Mild to moderate diastolic dysfunction. 
.
Exercise test ___
___ year old male with history of CAD (h/o MI x 2, multiple 
stents)referred for evaluation of shortness of breath. The 
patient underwent ___ protocol and completed 2.75 minutes 
___ METS), which is poor-to-fair exercise capacity. The 
patient noted substernal chest tightness and difficulty 
breathing at apporximately 2 minutes into the protocol. The 
discomfort increased and the patient requested study 
termination. The sensation resolved by 1 minute into recovery. 
No significant ST changes from baseline were noted. The rhythm 
was sinus with occasional isolated polymorphic VPBs and 
occasional APBs. Blood pressure increased with the limited 
exercise. 
IMPRESSION: Exercise-limiting anginal-type symptoms in the 
setting of
no ischemic ST changes. 
.  
EGD ___
Small hiatal hernia
Mucosa suggestive of short segment ___ esophagus (biopsy)
Polyps in the stomach body
Erosion, nodularity, friability and erythema in the whole 
stomach compatible with gastritis (biopsy)

 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Shortness of breath: 
- Pt had history of inferolateral MIs, and at that time he did 
not have exhibit any typical anginal chest pain/pressure, but 
rather experienced lightheadedness and dizziness with heaviness 
in the arms. 
- Pt previously had very good exercise tolerance as evidenced in 
Exercise MIBI in ___. Pt stated he was on a 15 mile 
bike ride as recently as 1 week prior to presentation, but since 
then, has been getting extremely SOB with much less exertion, 
such as climbing just one flight of stairs. 
- The fact that the patient's exercise tolerance dropped so 
acutely was concerning for a new myocardial infarct or ischemia. 
Exercise stress test with no imaging was done while being 
observed in the ED. It did not reveal any new ischemic changes 
on the EKG although the test had to be terminated due to extreme 
SOB.
- Pt's extensive cardiac history and symptomology were very 
concerning for ongoing ischemia despite flat cardiac enzymes. Pt 
underwent cardiac catherization with stent deployment to mid 
LCx. (Please see cardiac cath report in OMR for details, as 
final report is not available at this time). Pt tolerated the 
procedure well, and was discharged home the next day with 
instructions to continue ASA and Plavix and a follow-up 
appointment with his cardiologist. 
.
# GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX: pt had a history of GERD and feelings 
of dysphagia. Pt had undergone endoscopies as recently as ___ which revealed many polyps, small hiatal hernia, and a 
short segment of ___ esophagus. Some of pt's symptoms may 
have been GI-related (food getting stuck, etc). Pt was 
instructed to follow up with his gastroenterologist to receive 
further evaluation if symptoms persist. 
.
# BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY: Pt has been followed by an 
outpatient urologist. The condition appeared stable. Pt was 
continued on his home medications.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ yo male s/p 2 STEMI's in ___ and ___ with 4 
stents placed, HTN, HL, 64 pack year smoking hx who presents for 
an acute episode of nausea, which was his presenting sx for his 
previous MI.  Patient reports that for the last month he has 
been feeling "run down" and tired.  He thought that it was the 
heat, but reports that he "just feels uncomfortable", even 
though he was not having CP, SOB, N/V, F/C.  At baseline he 
walks his dog 3 miles/day, but 3 weeks ago he injured his R 
knee, so he can't determine what his exercise tolerance is since 
he started to feel "lousy".  

At 8am the morning of admission, patient was picking vegetables 
in his garden, when all of a sudden he felt very nauseated, 
started shaking and got very sweaty.  He reports that he did not 
have CP or SOB.  He walked inside to his house, drank some water 
and check his BP, which was 180/81, which he reports is very 
high for him.  He waited 5 mins and checked it again, and it was 
178/80, so he had his wife drive him in to the hospital.  On the 
drive in, the nausea, shaking and sweating stopped.  However, he 
is concerned that this may be another MI as "this felt just like 
my second heart attack".
