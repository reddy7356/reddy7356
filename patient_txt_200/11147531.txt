IMAGING:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) ___:
FINDINGS:  
The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable.  
There is 
persistent volume loss in the right hemithorax with band-like 
opacity in the right lower lung, a fiducial marker, and similar 
effacement of the right costophrenic sulcus.  However, the 
appearance is very similar to the prior study.  Although a 
persistent pleural effusion is difficult to exclude on the 
right, there is no evidence for one on the left. 
IMPRESSION:  
Stable appearance of the chest. 

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON ___:
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome. 
2. Severe emphysema with superimposed mild pulmonary edema. 
3. Increasing malignant soft tissue thickening encasing the 
right mainstem 
bronchus and adjacent structures. 
4. Diffuse septal thickening in both lungs, especially in upper 
lungs.  Given 
diffuse appearance, pulmonary edema is favored as the most 
likely etiology. 

TRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM ___:
IMPRESSION:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Late saline contrast is seen in 
left heart suggesting intrapulmonary shunting. The estimated 
right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF = 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests 
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). 
The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall 
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

MICROBIOLOGY:

___ 5:40 pm URINE

                            **FINAL REPORT ___

   URINE CULTURE (Final ___: 
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT 
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION. 

Time Taken Not Noted     Log-In Date/Time: ___ 2:35 pm
      BLOOD CULTURE

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y.o. woman with a history of COPD on 24h O2 3L NC, Stage II 
Squamous Cell Carcinoma s/p chemoradiation, Right Breast 
Invasive Lobuar Carcinoma s/p mastecomy presents with dyspnea 
and worsened hypoxia.

# Hypoxia: The patient was admitted in the setting of 
desaturating to 70% with minimal activity while already on 3L O2 
NC.  On admission, the patient's vital signs were VS T 97.0 HR 
107 BP 145/62 RR 18 SpO2 94% 4 L NC. The patient was initially 
on NRB in the ED where she received Methylpredisolone, nebs, and 
Azithromycin given concern for COPD exacerbation. CXR was 
unchanged from baseline. The patient had a Chest CT/CTA which 
was unremarkable for PE, but did demonstrate increasing 
malignant soft tissue thickening encasing the right mainstem 
bronchus and adjacent structures. The patient also had an TTE 
which demonstrated LVEF of 65% and late saline contrast is seen 
in left heart suggesting intrapulmonary shunting. The etiology 
of the patient's hypoxia was thought to be multifactorial: 
severe COPD vs possible lymphangitic spread of malignancy vs 
contribution from pulmonary shunting. The patient's presentation 
and exam was not convincing for a COPD exacerbation and 
prednisone and azithromycin were not continued. The patient's O2 
was increased to 5L NC and she was continued on 
albuterol/ipratropium nebs with improvement in her symptoms. The 
patient and her oncologist felt that she would not be a 
candidate for further interventions with regards to her 
malignancies and thus no further diagnostic workup 
(bronchosocopy, biopsies) were pursued during this 
hospitalization. At the time of discharge, the patient's dyspnea 
had improved and her oxygen saturation was 93-97% on ___ L NC. 

# Hypernatremia: Towards the end of her hospitalization, Na was 
found to be 147. Hypernatremia was thought to be due to poor 
fluid intake and diuresis. The patient's  calculated free H20 
deficit was 1.3 L. The patient was given D5W at 75 cc/hr for a 
total 1.3 L. At the time of discharge, Na improved to 142. 

# Goals of Care Discussion: Patient with end state COPD and 
possible recurrence of pulmonary and breast malignancy. Patient 
reports that she never had goals of care discussion. There is a 
possibility patient may need hospice care in the near future. 
Palliative care was consulted during this hospitalization. The 
patient expressed interest in outpatient followup with 
Palliative Care. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:

# Hypertension: The patient was continued on her home Lisinopril 
40 mg PO QDaily. 

# Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's home Metformin was held and 
was started on an insulin sliding scale during this 
hospitalization. The patient's FSGs were well-controlled. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[] Code Status: Full
[] Patient home O2 increased to ___ L NC continuous
[] Patient discharged with Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, nebulizer 
machine ordered
[] Blood cultures pending at discharge 
[] Patient will need Pulmonary followup for likely repeat PFTs, 
review of CTA for AVMs

[] Patient will need Palliative Care outpatient followup
[] Patient will need post-discharge PCP followup

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

___ was a pleasure caring for you during your hospitalization at 
the ___. As you know, you came 
in with shortness of breath and lower than your normal oxygen 
levels. We did X-rays and imaging of your chest which did not 
show any pneumonia or blood clots in your lungs. We treated you 
with more oxygen, steroids, and nebulizers. We did an ultrasound 
of your heart which did not show any abnormal findings. Your 
breathing and low oxygen improved with our treatments. We 
increased your home oxygen to ___ L 24 hours per day. We also 
ordered nebulizer machine for you to use with your home 
medications. 

Please take your medications as instructed. If you develop any 
worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or lightheadedness 
please seek medical attention urgently. Please followup with 
primary care care doctor and other health providers.
