PERTINENT IMAGING
===============================

___ CT NECK W/O CONTRAST FROM OSH

1. Focus of air in the area posterior to the trachea on the 
right, which could represent a tracheal diverticulum given its 
location, although no clear communication with the trachea is 
visualized, or possibly extraluminal air.  Potential 
communication with the esophagus could be evaluated if 
clinically indicated via a barium swallow study.   
2. Soft tissue in the anterior mediastinum is partially imaged 
and not well assessed on this exam. ___ represent thymic tissue 
but cannot exclude lymphomatous mass. Chest radiograph or CT 
could be obtained for further evaluation.  
3. Hyperdense small focus in the area of the right piriform 
sinus of unclear clinical significance. ___ be ammenable to 
direct visualization.  
ATTENDING NOTE: Unclear if air described above is due to surgery 
(if it is recent). Prominent upper cervical lymphnode with 
enlargement in left level II region.  

___ CXR

Cardiac and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  
Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace 
consolidation to suggest 
aspiration or pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  
No acute bony abnormality. 

___ BARIUM SWALLOW

Barium liquid passes freely from the oropharynx into the upper 
esophagus without evidence of obstruction.  On the AP and 
lateral views, there is no extraluminal extension of contrast to 
suggest leakage. The imaged lung apices are clear.  The imaged 
portion of the cervical spine isunremarkable. 
  
After the completion of the esophagram we were asked if we could 
assess the right piriform sinus for filling defect.  Distention 
views of the piriform sinus were not obtained during the 
examination.  No obliteration is seen, but a small focus such as 
that seen on the prior CT may not be apparant on this imaging. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No extraluminal extension of contrast to suggest 
leak 

___ CT NECK

The parotid glands and submandibular glands, are unremarkable. 
There is no 
cervical adenopathy.  The patient is status post right 
hemithyroidectomy. The left thyroid and isthmus are normal in 
appearance.  There is no evidence of esophageal or tracheal 
diverticulum identified. 
  
The aerodigestive tract appears normal. Included paranasal 
sinuses and 
mastoids are clear. 
  
Vascular structures in the neck are grossly unremarkable. No 
focal suspicious osseous lesion identified. 
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No evidence of esophageal or tracheal diverticulum.  No other 
significant 
change from the prior examination.

___ 06:30AM BLOOD TSH-2.___ year old female s/p right partial thyroidectomy ___ in 
___ for unknown reasons, presenting with dysphagia and 
odynophagia found to have right vocal cord paralysis, 
pirifiromis hyperdensity of unknown etiology, and posterior 
pharyngeal wall outpouching. Hospital course is outlined below 
by problem:

#  Neck pain/dysphagia:  Patient presented initially to an OSH 
with symptoms after a recent thyroidectomy in ___. CT neck 
at OSH was concerning for extraluminal free air and a potential 
retropharyngeal abscess/mass which prompted transfer to ___. 
ENT evaluation at ___ revealed right vocal cord paralysis. 
Unasyn was started on admit due to the concern for 
microperforation. She went to the ___ on ___ for direct 
pharyngoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy. A right hypopharyngeal 
lesion was identified and biopsied (results were pending at time 
of discharge). Patient was maintained on NPO diet and aspiration 
precautions. Patient was also maintained on PPI BID because of 
evidence of erythema throughout esophagus on scope. A CT neck 
with oral contrast was obtained and did not show evidence of 
perforation. As a result antibiotics were discontinued. A video 
swallow evaluation was performed and patient was cleared for a 
regular diet with thin liquids. The study revealed a small right 
sided diverticulum above the level of the UES that emptied with 
liquids but collected solids and cleared with liquids. 
Speech/swallow recommended ENT outpatient follow-up for this 
issue. Patient received education regarding aspiration 
precautions and tolerated a regular diet prior to discharge.

# Hyperdensity of piriformis: of unknown etiology. Hyperdensity 
was visualized on CT neck. ENT was unable to visualize foreign 
body object on scope. Further imaging was not pursued as 
inpatient. Further imaging should be pursued as outpatient based 
on ENT recommendations.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# f/u pharyngeal mass biopsies - results pending at time of 
discharge
# Hyperdense small focus in the area of the right piriform sinus 
of unclear clinical significance - will need further ENT workup 
as outpatient
# discharged on high dose PPI therapy - determine duration and 
intensity of PPI therapy as outpatient
# patient is able to tolerate both PO solids, liquids and pills 
- received education about aspiration precautions. Instructed to 
drink a small amount of liquid after each bite
# Blood cultures ___ pending

the irritation that was found in your throat as well. You 
received education about aspiration precautions, which you will 
need to follow when you leave the hospital. Briefly, you should 
sit upright when eating all meals. You should take small bites 
and place a small amount of food in your mouth. You should also
