Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Catheterization ___
LMCA: Angiographically unremarkable.
LAD: Proximal 90% stenosis; 90% mid stenosis. ___ Diag 90% 
stenosis. The lesion was diffuse. Diagonal is small caliber with 
severe diffuse disease.
LCx: Mid 60% stenosis. ___ LPL ostial 90% stenosis. ___ LPL 90% 
stenosis. The lesion was diffuse.
RCA: Mid 99% stenosis. Distal RCA 100% stenosis.
Ramus: Ostial 90% stenosis.
Cardiac Collaterals
- Moderate collateral flow from the ___ LPL to the R PDA.
.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram ___
The left atrial volume index is normal. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is 
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild 
basal inferior / inferoseptal hypokinesis (RCA territory; see 
schematic) and preserved/normal contractility of the remaining 
segments. The visually estimated left ventricular ejection 
fraction is 50%. There is no resting left ventricular outflow 
tract gradient. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal 
free wall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender 
with normal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch 
diameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic 
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
with no mitral valve prolapse. There is trivial mitral 
regurgitation. The pulmonic valve leaflets are not well seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally normal. There 
is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be estimated. There is no 
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
mild regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with coronary 
artery disease. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted on ___ and underwent routine preoperative 
testing and evaluation. He remained stable and was taken to the 
operating room on ___. He underwent coronary artery bypass 
grafting to four vessels. Please see operative note for full 
details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to 
the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive 
monitoring. 
  
He weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and was 
extubated on POD 1. He was weaned from vasopressor support. Beta 
blocker was initiated and he was diuresed toward his 
preoperative weight. He remained hemodynamically stable and was 
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. ___ 
was consulted for Diabetes management. He was evaluated by the 
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility. Scant sternal drainage was noted without erythema, 
wound was well approximated and his sternum was stable. By the 
time of discharge on post-operative day five he was ambulating 
freely, his wound was healing, and his pain was controlled with 
oral analgesics. He was discharged to home in good condition 
with appropriate follow up instructions.
