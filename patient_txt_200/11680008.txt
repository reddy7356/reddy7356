Chief Complaint:
disequlibrium and L leg heaviness
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
na
 
History of Present Illness:
The patient is a ___ year old man with a history of HTN, HLD,
NSTEMI, pre-DM, depression, presenting with an episode of
disequlibrium and L leg heaviness which is now resolved.

The patient was in his normal state of health until 4 AM when he
woke up to go to the bathroom (which he commonly does several
times per night). Lying in bed after waking up he experienced a
rocking type sensation of movement. When he stood up he felt 
very
unsteady and off balance. Denied frank vertigo or presyncope. He
had to hold onto the walls and the furniture while walking to 
the
bathroom, and held onto the sink to sit down onto the toilet. He
felt nausous but did not vomit. He used the bathroom and was 
able
to walk back to bed with difficulty and went back to sleep. He
woke up again around 9 AM and went downstairs for breakfast.
Walking down the stairs, he noted a feeling of heaviness in his 
L
leg. He did not trip or fall or notice frank weakness, but did
have this sensation of heaviness. He still had some persistant
disequlibrium (had to hold onto the railing for support) and
nausea but this was not as severe as previously. He got
downstairs and took a sip of tea but was not hungry enough to 
eat
more breakfast. He told his family he was feelign off and his
brother (a doctor) came over to check him out, taking an EKG and
vitals signs, and recommended he go to the ED. He did not feel
well enough to drive himself so his daughter drove him to the ED
around 11:30. His symptoms continued to improve during this time
and by the time of my evaluation (3:30 ___ these were completely
resolved. 

The patient has had some achy posterior L shoulder pain several
inches below the base of his L neck, just above his scapula. 
This
is an achy nagging pain. No injury to his neck or shoulder
recently or atypical physical activity is reported.

posterior 
circulation infarction. 
  
2.  Arachnoid cyst or asymmetric ___ cisterna magna in the 
posterior fossa, more onto the left side, unchanged since ___ with indentation on the adjacent cerebellar hemispheres,

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr ___ is a ___ yo man with a history of HTN, HLD, NSTEMI, 
pre-DM and depression who presented with disequlibrium and L leg 
heaviness which resolved by the time of neurologic evaluation. 
Neuro exam was notable for subtle left side clumsiness in upper 
and lower extr and mild left sided dysmetria. MRI is without 
evidence of infarct. CTA head and neck with ~40% stenosis at the 
origin of the left vertebral artery. Given that his exam is 
still subtly abnormal this is most likely an MRI negative 
stroke, cerebellar vs brainstem. Given multiple stroke risk 
factors we will assume this is a stroke. We have increased his 
aspirin to 325mg daily. No other changes were made. He had a 
recent ECHO so this was not repeated. Cause of his stroke may 
have been related to his stenosis of the vertebral artery vs 
small vessel disease.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of disequlibrium and left 
leg heaviness resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition in which a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients 
to the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.

Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
pre-diabetes 
high cholesterol 

We are changing your medications as follows:
increasing your aspirin to 325mg daily 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.

Imaging Studies:
ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal 
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are 
normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch 
levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears 
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 
 
You were admitted to the ___ for 
evaluation of chest pain. Based on blood work, it became 
apparent that your pain was coming from blocked cardiac 
arteries. You underwent a cardiac catherization the morning 
after admission that showed that you had a narrowed coronary 
artery. A balloon was placed to open up the artery. This 
procedure restored better flow to your artery. You were observed 
for 24 hours and were deemed stable for discharge home. 
.
You should not do any heavy lifting or vigorous exercise for 1 
week.
.
During your hospitalization, some of your medications changed. 
Please START taking the following:
- aspirin 325mg daily
- plavix 75mg daily**** Take this medication every day until 
advised otherwise*** 
- atorvastatin 80mg daily
- metoprolol 25mg BID

Please STOP:
- Nifedipine (as this may lower your blood pressure too much 
while taking metoprolol, please discuss restarting this 
medication with your doctors)

It is important that you take these medications every day. It is 
especially important that you do not stop taking plavix as this 
may cause another blocked artery in your cardiac vessels. 

You should follow up with your cardiologist.
