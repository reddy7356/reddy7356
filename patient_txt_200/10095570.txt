STUDIES/IMAGING:
RUQ U/S ___: FINDINGS:  
LIVER: The liver is coarsened and nodular in echotexture. The 
contour of the liver is nodular, consistent with cirrhosis. 
There is no focal liver mass although the underlying echotexture 
of the liver limits sensitivity for detection of small nodules. 
No appreciable flow can be seen within the main portal vein or 
splenic vein at the confluence with the SMV by color Doppler, 
consistent with portal vein thrombosis. There is a small amount 
of ascites. 
BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CBD 
measures 2.7 mm. 
GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder is decompressed, limiting 
evaluation. Hyperechoic foci within the gallbladder likely 
represent small stones or polyps. PANCREAS: Imaged portion of 
the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or 
pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail 
obscured by overlying bowel gas. 
SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 15.3 cm. 
KIDNEYS: The right kidney measures 10.4 cm. The left kidney 
measures 10.3 cm. Normal cortical echogenicity and 
corticomedullary differentiation is seen bilaterally. There is 
no evidence of masses, stones, or hydronephrosis in the kidneys. 

RETROPERITONEUM: Visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within 
normal 
limits. 
IMPRESSION: 
1. Absent blood flow within the main portal vein consistent with 
portal venous thrombosis. 
2. Cirrhotic liver with a small amount of ascites and 
splenomegaly. 

CXR ___: FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest. 
  Clips in the soft tissues of the lower neck noted. Lung 
volumes are low limiting assessment. Allowing for this, the 
lungs appear clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly 
normal. Bony structures are intact. No free air below the right 
hemidiaphragm. 
IMPRESSION: No acute findings. Limited exam. 

CT ABD/PELVIS ___:
FINDINGS: Please see the dedicated CT chest report from the same 
day for detailed evaluation of the chest. 
LIVER: The nonenhanced appearance of the livershows 
hepatomegaly.  Noncontrast 
CT cannot evaluate for focal liver lesions. There is a small 
amount of 
perihepatic Send free fluid The gallbladder is nondistended, 
without 
pericholecystic fluid or fat stranding.  Faint hyperdensities 
within the lumen may represent gallstones. 
SPLEEN: The spleen is homogeneous in attenuation and at the 
upper limits of normal in size, measuring 12.8 cm. 
PANCREAS: The pancreas is without focal lesion or peripancreatic 
stranding or fluid collection. 
ADRENALS: The adrenal glands are unremarkable. 
KIDNEYS: The kidneys are symmetric and normal in size, without 
stone or 
hydronephrosis. 
GI:The stomach is decompressed, but there is no obvious 
intraluminal mass or wall thickening.  Numerous small rounded 
densities along the lesser curvature may represent 
lymphadenopathy or varices. The small and large bowel are normal 
in caliber, without evidence of obstruction.  Evaluation of the 
bowel wall is limited secondary to underdistention and lack of 
IV contrast, but there is no obvious area of wall thickening.A 
normal, air-filled appendix is visualized.  There is a small 
amount of simple free fluid along the right pericolic gutter and 
in the lower abdomen. 
RETROPERITONEUM: The aorta is normal in caliber, with moderate 
atherosclerotic calcifications.Retroperitoneal lymph nodes are 
increased in number, but not pathologically enlarged by CT size 
criteria.  No mesenteric adenopathy is 
identified. 
CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is decompressed by a Foley 
catheter.No pelvic wall or inguinal lymph node enlargement by CT 
size criteria is seen.There is a small to moderate amount of 
pelvic free fluid. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:No focal lesion suspicious for malignancy 
present. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Exam limited by lack of IV contrast. Within these 
limitations, no acute intra-abdominal process to explain the 
patient's presentation. 
2. Likely sequela of portal hypertension related to known 
cirrhosis, including hepatomegaly, mild splenomegaly and 
ascites.  Cannot assess for focal liver lesions. 
3. Retroperitoneal lymph nodes increased in number, but not 
pathologically enlarged by CT size criteria. 

CT CHEST ___:
FINDINGS: This exam is limited secondary to respiratory motion 
artifact. There is a 2.7 x 2.8 x 2.6 cm mass in the right upper 
lobe (4:87, 6:40), which exerts mass effect upon the upper lobe 
bronchus (4:104, 105). Multiple scattered small opacities (for 
example, 4:84, 92, 93, 96, 109, 125) could represent nodules 
versus small foci of nodular opacity consistent 
withinfection/inflammation. More confluent opacity in the left 
apex (4:57, 6:44) is likely infectious. There is dependent 
atelectasis bilaterally. There is no supraclavicular, axillary, 
or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Hilar lymphadenopathy is 
difficult to evaluate without IV contrast, but there does appear 
to be increased soft tissue within the hila bilaterally, 
particularly on the right, consistent with enlarged lymph nodes. 
The pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged, measuring 3.6 cm. This 
is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of pulmonary hypertension. 
Cardiac configuration is within normal limits. Coronary artery 
calcifications are noted. 
The thyroid gland is within normal limits. There is no 
concerning focal lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion. Please see 
the CT abdomen/ pelvis report for detailed evaluation of the 
infra diaphragmatic structures. 
IMPRESSION:  
This exam is limited secondary to respiratory motion artifact. 
1. Right upper lobe mass, which exerts mass effect upon the 
upper lobe 
bronchus. 
2. Multiple scattered nodular opacities, unclear if metastatic 
versus 
infectious/ inflammatory. 
3. More confluent opacity in the left apex is likely infectious, 
cannot r/o malignancy (BAC)11. 
4. Likely right hilar lymphadenopathy, although difficult to 
evaluate without IV contrast. 
5. Mildly enlarged pulmonary artery, suggestive but not 
diagnostic of 
pulmonary hypertension.

DISCHARGE LABS;
N/A
 
Brief Hospital Course:
>> PATIENT: Mr ___ is a ___ male with PMH of 
hypertension, CHF who initially presented to ___ with ___ 
weeks of weakness and jaundice, found to have cirrhosis, portal 
venous thrombosis, significant hyperkalemia, and ___. 
.
>>  BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr ___ presented initially with hyperkalemia, weakness and an 
acute kidney injury. He was hyperkalemia was temporized in the 
ED via standard medical interventions, and he was then admitted 
to the ICU. His hyperkalemia was treated with kayexalate and 
furosemide; however, he remained persistently hyperkalemic 
thoughout his hospital course (without substantive EKG changes). 
An abdominal ultrasound was performed given elevation in his 
transaminases on admission, and the U/S identified a possible 
portal vein thrombosis. Infectious work-up, including diagnostic 
paracentesis, did not identify a source of patient's symptoms. 
The increase in transaminases on admission was felt to be due to 
underlying NASH-related cirrhosis. Viral seroligies were notable 
for a cleared hepatitis B infection, but otherwise were 
unrevealing for a cause of elevated transaminases. The 
Hepatology service was consult for aid in management. Mr. ___ 
early hospital course was also complicated by atrial flutter 
with rapid ventricular response, and this was initially 
controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol, but refractory 
RVR required him to be given an amiodarone load.
.
On ___, Mr. ___ an abrupt clinical decline. He 
initially had abdominal pain with tense abdomen, but CT of the 
abdomen and pelvis did not reveal acute causative findgs. He 
became persistently acidemic and hyperkalemic. He developed 
marked respiratory distress from his underlying acidemia and was 
intubated for increased work of breathing, multiorgan system 
failure, and his overall acutely deteriorating clinical status. 
He had initially received bicarbonate for correction of severe 
academia, in concert with the Renal service's recommendations. 
At the time of his precipitous clinical deterioration on ___, 
his labratory values were notable for an extreme rise in 
transaminases from the low 300s on admissions to the 6000s in 
less than 24 hours. Phosphate and uric acid were noted to be 
markedly elevated and in conjunction with refractory 
hyperkalemia and worsening oliguria, so a HD line was emergently 
placed and he was started on CRRT. Chest CT demonstrated 
bibasilar consolidations (likely atelectasis) and a dense right 
upper lobe ___ lung mass. Given the constellation of this 
new lung mass, diffuse lymphadenopathy,and clinical / laboratory 
findings consistent with tumor lysis syndrome, the Heme/Onc 
service was consulted for concern of tumor lysis syndrome. 

In addition, on the evening of ___ Mr ___ had several episodes 
of bradycardia. Nodal-blocking agents were stopped (they had 
been provided to this point for the aforementioned difficult to 
control A flutter with RVR), but his bradycardia persisted, 
briefly requiring transcutaneous pacing before being maintained 
on a dopamine drip. His bradycardia and hypotension became 
increasingly worse, eventually requiring four pressor agents for 
support. A transvenous pacing wire was placed and with this 
suport, pressors were initially able to be somewhat and 
transiently down-titrted.
.
However, in the AM of ___, Mr ___ began experiencing 
___ increasing pressor requirements once again. He 
began to have an increasing oxygen demand. Labratory values 
continued to worsen. Discussions with the family were held and 
given his extremely poor prognosis, the medical team deemed 
resucitative efforts (such as chest compressions in the event of 
cardiac arrest) to be not clinically indicated or medically 
appropriate. Several of Mr ___ remote family members were 
called in and were able to be with him. Mr ___ developed asystole 
without pacer capture mid-day on ___ and passed peacefully with 
family present at bedside. Autopsy was offered by medical staff 
and family declined; they did, however, express gratitude for 
the care he had received during his stay at ___ and all of 
their questions about his clinical circumstances were answered.
