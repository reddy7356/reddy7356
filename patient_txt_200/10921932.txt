PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Well-appearing male in no
acute distress. Performance status 1. VITAL SIGNS:  96.1, 89,
18, 141/78, O2 sat 98% on room air. HEENT:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic without oral lesions. HEART:  Regular rate and
rhythm. Respirations clear bilaterally. SKIN:  Scattered
folliculitis.  Neuro exam nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABS:  Admission labs WBC 13.7, hemoglobin 11.8,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. ___ was admitted and underwent
central line placement to begin therapy. His central line tip
removed on ___ grew staph aureus coag positive with
blood cultures done prior to removal of being negative. In
addition, his MRSA screen via nasal swab was also negative
for week one. A repeat nasal swab was sent on admission which
was positive for MRSA. He has a prior history of MRSA
colonization and was not felt to be infected.

He underwent central line placement at the bedside to begin
IL-2 therapy. His admission weight was 170 kg. He received
interleukin-2 600,000 international units per kilo based on
adjusted ideal body weight equaling 74.4 million units of IL-
2 every 8 hours times 14 potential doses. During this week,
he received two of 14 doses with IL-2 held on treatment day
#2 due to development of acute hypoxia, shortness of breath
and diaphoresis at approximately 10:00 a.m.. His third dose
of IL-2 therapy had been placed on hold due to low urine
output overnight. At approximately 10:00 a.m., he complained
of shortness of breath and was found to be diaphoretic with
oxygen saturations in the mid ___ compared to a prior reading
of 98% on room air. This occurred in the setting of the
patient having that not of bed unassisted with his central
line becoming disconnected with the alligator clamp had
active bleeding of the central line as an open system. The
patient was not hypotensive. EKG revealed ___ normal sinus
rhythm without ischemic changes. Oxygen saturation improved
on 100% non-rebreather. ICU consult was called and the
patient was transferred to the ICU for further management and
workup of questionable air embolus versus pulmonary embolus.
He underwent CT angio which was negative for pulmonary
embolus. Echocardiogram was performed and was found to be
within normal limits without thrombus noted. It was felt to
the etiology of his hypoxia, dyspnea and chest pain was from
an air embolus related to central line disconnection. His
oxygenation status improved over the next ___ hours and he was
weaned to room air with O2 sats in the high ___. He remained
in normal sinus rhythm without ectopy or hypotension. He was
transferred back to the floor on treatment day #3. Further IL-
2 therapy was held. He was discharged to home on ___.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan: The patient is a MRSA colonized ___ 
male with metastatic melanoma s/p right parietal resection of 
brain met on ___ immunosuppressed on steroids admitted with 
right upper extremity cellulitis. 
.
#Cellulitis: He was treated with IV vancomycin for ~ 60 hours

48 hours. His cellulitis improved on vancomycin and the patient 
had no signs of systemic infection. After discussion with  Dr. 
___ was changed to doxycycline 100 mg BID for 10 days

recommended considering liberalizing his use of ativan if it 
helped with the patient's low level anxiety. The recommendation 
was conveyed to the patient's primary oncologist and deferred to
