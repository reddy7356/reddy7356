Chief Complaint:
Difficulty producing speech
 
Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NA
 
History of Present Illness:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ h/o multiple strokes, HTN, HLD p/w
diminished, non-fluent speech output. 

Her neurologic history began in ___ with a left occipital
infarct due to presumed artery-to-artery embolus for which she
was briefly treated with coumadin. This left her with a right
field homonymous hemianopsia. She has since been on aspirin and
atorvastatin. She has not been seen by Dr. ___
neurologist, since ___. She has had some syncopal episodes in
the past and these were attributed to low blood pressure (most
recently in ___ seen in the ED). She may have had
non-fluent speech at that time per her daughter, but this was 
not
mentioned in ED documents and neurology was not consulted. 

Recently, the patient has been at her baseline and has not had
infections or anything that sounds like a TIA. She was at dinner
with her niece and daughter this evening and towards the end of
the meal, they noticed that the patient's speech output was
decreased. She seemed to understand what was being said to her
but she only responded with a word or two. She was searching
around in her purse for something, though it was not clear what.
She generally seemed to be acting in an odd manner. They were
concerned about stroke; they are under the impression that back
in ___ she did have a stroke (again, this does not correlate 
with
ED documentation). 

She was brought to ___ where initial VS were 0 97.8 69 185/66
16 100% with a ___ of 156. Initially, she could not say her name
and only occasionally was able to produce a word. Code stroke 
was
called for possible aphasia. This improved by the time I arrived
but she still could not name hammock or cactus. She was
disoriented to the month (___) but otherwise she only had
field cuts. NCHCT did not show any acute infarction though there
has been progression of cerebrovascular disease (esp small 
vessel
L>R) since her last scan a decade ago. CTA did not show any
large-vessel cut-offs. Her EtOH level returned at 210; the
remainder of the work-up was unrevealing. Her NIHSS was very low
and she had rapidly improving deficits so she did not get tPA. 

ROS: Positive for occasional neck pain (not actually present at
the moment but intermittent over the past few weeks when she
turns her head), old field cut (says that left inferior quadrant
has not had vision recently). Denies any previous difficulty
comprehending, producing, or articulating speech. No acute 
vision
changes. No numbness of the face or body and no weakness of the
face or body. No hearing changes or dizziness. No
coughing/gagging on food. No incontinence. Medical ROS negative
for F/C, ear pain, rhinorrhea, cough, CP, SOB, abdominal pain,
N/V/C/D, myalgias, arthralgias, rash.

___ ___ negative 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ yo independent ___ woman with HTN who presented in 
the setting of almost two weeks of nonspecific weakness, 
personality change, acute onset of non-fluent aphasia. On 
presentation she was noted to have a right homonomous 
hemianopsia, some frontal signs (mildly blunted affect, trouble 
with luria sequencing) and some parietal signs (unable to label 
a clock/apraxic, right parietal upwards drift). The patient was 
found to have an EtOH level of 210. The patient's aphasia 
resolved and her other symptoms/signs have remained and are 
likely chronic. Her MRI showed an old left occipital infarct 
(corresponding to her right field cut), significant volume loss, 
and a subacute infarct vs T2 shine though/artifact in the left 
caudate. The patient is being treated for assumed TIA though her 
intoxication likely contributed to her presenting symptoms. Plan 
to switch the patient from asa to plavix which was discussed 
with the pt's primary care doctor.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of trouble with your 
speech which may have been the result of a TIA (Transient 
Ischemic Attack), a condition in which a blood vessel providing 
oxygen and nutrients to the brain is temporarily blocked by a 
blood clot. The brain is the part of your body that controls and 
directs all the other parts of your body, so damage to the brain 
from being deprived of its blood supply can result in a variety 
of symptoms.
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:
- high blood pressure
- high cholesterol 

We are changing your medications as follows:
Adding a medication call PLAVIX to prevent blood clots 

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.
If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:
- sudden partial or complete loss of vision
- sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth
- sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you
- sudden weakness of one side of the body
- sudden drooping of one side of the face
- sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body
- sudden difficulty pronouncing words (slurring of speech)
- sudden blurring or doubling of vision
- sudden onset of vertigo (sensation of your environment 
spinning around you)
- sudden clumsiness of the arm and leg on one side or sudden 
tendency to fall to one side (left or right)
- sudden severe headache accompanied by the inability to stay 
awake
It was a pleasure providing you with care during this 
hospitalization.
 
Followup Instructions:
