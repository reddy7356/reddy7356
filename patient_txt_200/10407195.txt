IMAGING/STUDIES:
======================
Conclusions   
 The left atrial volume index is moderately increased. The right 
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ 
mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function 
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. 
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. Increased PCWP. 

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable 
for review) of ___, the findings are similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: 
Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the 
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical 
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on

recent admission for BRBPR (___) who presented with 1 episode 
of black diarrhea and complaint of lightheadedness.

# Lightheadedness. Patient described new lightheadedness the 
morning after his episode of black diarrhea, however he did get 
up multiple times during the night to urinate without any 
lightheadedness. With his interval of no lightheadedness and 
stable hemoglobin compared to baseline, lightheadedness due to 
GIB was thought to be unlikely. Instead, he was thought to have 
orthostatic hypotension, possibly exacerbated by his 
antihypertensive medications. He was recorded to have 
orthostatic hypotension on the morning of ___. He was 
continued on his antihypertensives but scheduled with cardiology 
and primary care as an outpatient to discuss possibly decreasing 
them. Given his history of cardiomyopathy and concern for 
arrhythmia he was monitored on tele (no abnormalities noted) and 
he had an echo done which showed EF>55%, stable from prior.

# Melena. Patient has a history of BRBPR likely secondary to 
hemorrhoids but concern for more significant bleeding given his 
report of melena so GI recommended admission. He had no 
additional bleeding or dark stools during this admission. His 
H/H downtrended on the morning of ___ but with similar 
downtrend of WBC and platelets so this was thought to be 
dilutional. He had a colonoscopy in ___ that was normal but was 
recommended to get a repeat in ___ years due to a family history 
of colon cancer. He was set up with an outpatient GI appointment 
for colonoscopy at discharge. 
 
# Paget's disease of bone. Patient was noted to have elevated 
Alk phos (356 on admission). This was also elevated in ___ 
(443) and has been elevated as far back as ___. He had a CT 
scan showing Paget's disease of left pelvis ___. He has a 
normal calcium and borderline low vitamin D (27). It is possible 
that his chronic back pain is related to Paget's disease and 
that he might benefit from treatment. He was scheduled with 
endocrinology as an outpatient. 

Chronic issues: 
# Dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 50%). Patient continued on home 
nifedipine, spironolactone, enalapril. TTE done which showed EF 
55%, no change from prior TTE.

# CKD. Baseline Cr. 1.3-1.5. Cr at baseline and stable this 
admission.

# HTN. Patient continued on antihypertensive regimen as listed 
above.

# HLD. Patient continued on home atorvastatin.

# BPH. Patient continued on home tamsulosin.

# Hemorrhoids. Patient continued on home hydrocortisone cream.

# Transitional issues:
-Given patient's lightheadedness (worse in the morning), may 
want to consider lowering dose of his antihypertensive 
(particularly his evening nifedipine).
-Patient found to have occasional gait instability at baseline, 
advised to use walker at home and continue outpatient ___.
-On a CT A/P from ___ done at ___, the patient 
was noted to have lesion of the left pelvis demonstrating Paget 
Disease (which is consistent with his chronically elevated 
alkaline phosphatase). He should follow up with endocrinology 
for this finding. Specifically, it would be worthwhile to 
determine if his back pain is ___ to Paget's.
-TTE performed as inpatient shows: EF>55%, Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Increased PCWP.
-Patient should have a colonoscopy as an outpatient
-Patient had been taking 400-800 mg ibuprofen per day for back 
pain and was advised to stop taking all NSAIDs given melena

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were in the hospital at ___ 
because you were feeling dizzy and had one dark stool. You did 
not have any more bloody bowel movements while in the hospital 
and your dizziness improved. You were most likely dizzy because 
of low blood pressure when you stand up. This may be due to 
dehydration as well as some of the blood pressure medications 
that you take. Your heart was monitored throughout your stay and 
did not show any irregular beats, and your echocardiogram was 
stable. You should be careful to take your time after sitting up 
before trying to stand. You were also found to be unsteady on 
your feet. You should use your walker when walking as this will 
help prevent falls and continue physical therapy.  

You should get a colonoscopy due to the dark stool that you had. 
You may also be able to help prevent these episodes by 
preventing constipation. You should take Dulcolax and Miralax 
every day as prescribed unless you are having diarrhea. You 
should also stop taking all ibuprofen (as well as similar 
medications such as Aleve, Advil, and Motrin) since this can 
cause bleeding from the stomach.  

Lastly, you should follow up with an endocrinologist to 
determine if you have Paget's Disease, which is a bone disease 
that may explain your back pain. You have an appointment listed 
below. 

It has been a pleasure participating in your care. We wish you 
all the ___ in the future.

Please give this discharge paperwork to your daughter. Below is 
a list of transitional issues for you to follow up on with your 
doctors:
Transitional issues:
-Given patient's lightheadedness (worse in the morning), may 
want to consider lowering dose of his antihypertensive 
(particularly his evening nifedipine).
-Patient found to have occasional gait instability at baseline, 
advised to use walker at home and continue outpatient ___. 
-On a CT A/P from ___ done at ___, the patient 
was noted to have lesion of the left pelvis demonstrating Paget 
Disease (which is consistent with his chronically elevated 
alkaline phosphatase). He should follow up with endocrinology 
for this finding. Specifically, it would be worthwhile to 
determine if his back pain is ___ to Paget's.
-TTE performed as inpatient shows: EF>55%, Mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Increased PCWP. 
-Patient should have a colonoscopy as an outpatient

BRIEF SUMMARY: 
==============
Mr. ___ is a ___ y.o. gentleman w/ a h/o mild dilated 
cardiomyopathy (prior 55% in ___ --> now EF 30% ___, 
HTN, HLD, Paget's disease, benign ventricular ectopy, PAD s/p 
stenting of R SFA ___ w/ re-stenting of mid and distal R SFA 
___, CKD, and obesity who presented w/ several day h/o cough 
and dyspnea, now being transferred to the cardiology service for 
further management of newly reduced EF.

CORONARIES: Unknown, ETT ___ with no ischemic changes
PUMP: EF 30% 2+ TR 
RHYTHM: Sinus with freq PVCs

=============== 
ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=============== 
# Acute on chronic mixed systolic/diastolic HF (prev EF 55% -> 
now visualized EF estimated ~45%, reported 30%) 
Mr. ___ initially presented with ___ days SOB and cough and 
was treated with CTX/Azithromycin for ? CAP given leukocytosis 
and evidence of bronchial thickening on CXR though no obvious 
consolidations. TTE in evaluation of dyspnea showed newly 
reduced EF of 30% from prior EF of 55% in ___, w/ 2+ TR and 
PASP, frequent PVCs with new RV hypokinesis and possible 
inferior/posterior hypokinesis concerning for prior ischemia. 
However, on review of his TTE on rounds, his systolic function 
appears to be better than reported EF of 30%, and is estimated 
to be closer to 45%. The calculated EF may seem abnormal in the 
setting of frequent PVCs. He likely has mixed 
ischemic/nonischemic cardiomyopathy with contributions from 
underlying CAD given his hx of PAD (however per history does not 
seem to have had a recent missed MI), ongoing HTN, as well as 
ongoing benign ventricular ectopy. Ischemic workup was deferred 
as patient had no symptoms of angina. TSH wnl, iron studies w/o 
evidence of overload. After receiving 1L NS on ___ for presumed 
pre-renal ___, patient had evidence of volume overload on CXR 
and so was diuresed actively with Lasix 20mg + 40mg on ___. He 
appeared relatively euvolemic after this and was trialed on PO 
Lasix 40mg on ___ with good effect. He did not require any 
further diuresis. His home nifedipine was discontinued given his 
newly reduced EF and carvedilol 6.25mg BID was started for both 
afterload and NHBK. His home enalapril and spironolactone were 
held on discharge given his ___ and should be restarted with 
resolution of his ___. His discharge weight was 242lb (110 kg), 
discharge Cr 1.9. Ischemic workup should be considered if within 
goals of care if patient has episodes of angina. 

# ___ on CKD
Baseline Cr 1.3-1.7 (last Cr ___, presented with Cr 2.6, 
uptrended to 2.8 with fluid administration. CXR w/ e/o possible 
volume overload following 1L NS on ___. PVR not elevated. Renal 
US ___ with no hydronephrosis, concerning for obstructive 
uropathy. He was diuresed with good effect with Cr 2.5->2.0. 
Home enalapril and spironolactone were HELD throughout admission 
and on discharge in setting of his ___. He was seen by renal who 
recommended starting sodium bicarbonate 650mg TID for metabolic 
acidosis thought ___ renal dysfunction. His Cr on discharge was 
1.9. He should follow up with Dr. ___ in ___ weeks as an 
outpatient. 

#Cough
#Community acquired PNA 
#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure
Patient presented with cough and dyspnea as above. Initial CXR 
without focal consolidation but repeat following IVFs with b/l 
opacities with c/f infection +/- volume overload and worsening 
WBC. He completed a 5 day course of CTX/azithromycin from 
___ and was weaned to room air with improvement in his 
symptoms of cough. 

# Bacterial conjunctivitis:
Patient presented with copious purulent discharge in bilateral 
eyes, left>right on presentation that rapidly reappears after 
wiping eyes consistent with bacterial conjunctivitis. He was 
treated with erythromycin eye gtts x7d (___). 

#Anemia: 
Hgb 10.5, low MCV which is chronic. Fe studies most c/w anemia 
of chronic disease.

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
================ 
CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
# HTN
- STOPPED nifedipine given newly reduced EF, carvedilol started 
as above, home enalapril and spironolactone held during 
hospitalization and on discharge given ongoing ___. His home 
enalapril should be restarted once his ___ resolves, with 
consideration of restarting home spironolactone is his kidney 
function remains stable and his BPs are able to tolerate it 

# HLD:
- Increased home atorvastatin to 40 mg daily given known PAD and 
likely CAD. 

# CAD/PVD:
- Reduced full dose ASA to 81mg daily as there was no clear 
indication for full dose aspirin 

# BPH:
- Continued tamsulosin, finasteride

# Glaucoma:
- Continued eye gtts
