IMAGING:
========
___ SECOND OPINION MRI MSK RIGHT FOOT

IMPRESSION:  
  
1.  Finding most suggestive of osteomyelitis of the fourth toe.  
There has 
been interval amputation of this toe. 
2.  Destruction of the head of the second metatarsal and base of 
the second 
toe proximal phalanx with T1 marrow replacement and apparent 
prominent 
enhancement is concerning for osteomyelitis ___ the proper 
clinical setting 
particularly given the near normal appearance of this joint on 
x-ray from ___ and confirmed osteomyelitis of the fourth toe.  
Alternative 
considerations include a destructive inflammatory arthropathy or 
destruction 
___ a neuropathic foot.  Nuclear medicine study could be 
considered for further 
evaluation if clinically indicated. 
3.  Destruction and T1 marrow replacement across the third toe 
PIP joint could 
represent sequela of septic arthritis given the relative normal 
appearance of 
the joint on x-ray from ___ and confirmed 
osteomyelitis of the 
fourth toe.  Alternative considerations include a destructive 
inflammatory 
arthropathy or destruction due to chronic fracture. 
4.  Flattening of the head of the ___ third metatarsal with bone 
marrow edema 
and mild T1 marrow replacement could represent a more of a 
chronic remodeling 
process such ___ infraction, however infection could have a 
similar 
appearance. 
5.  Erosive change along the plantar lateral aspect of the head 
of the first 
metatarsal may be less likely to be infectious as there is 
minimal surrounding 
bone marrow edema. 
6.  Area of soft tissue nonenhancement along the plantar lateral 
aspect of the 
forefoot underlying the heads of the third and fourth 
metatarsals likely 
represents poor tissue perfusion. 

___ UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
IMPRESSION: 
 
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis ___ the right lower 
extremity veins.
 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ year old female with past medical history of type 
1 diabetes, COPD, CHF NOS admitted ___ with R ___ toe soft 
tissue infection and acute osteomyelitis failing to improve on 
antibiotics, now status post ___ toe amputation, pathology with 
clean margins, discharged home 

# Acute R ___ toe osteomyelitis and soft tissue infection
# Infection with enterococcus and MSSA 
Patient was transferred from ___ after presenting 
with worsening R toe ulcer with an MRI concerning for 
osteomyelitis.  Labs were notable for elevated CRP to 85.4.  
Patient was seen by podiatry service, underwent ABI/PVR did not 
show evidence of lower extremity ischemia at rest. Given ___ 
toe osteomyelitis, patient underwent amputation of R ___ toe 
with podiatry without complications.  OR cultures grew MSSA, 
enterococcus and mixed bacterial anaerobic flora. Patient was 
seen by ID and treated with an IV vancomycin, cefepime 
(transitioned to cefazolin), metronidazole (D1 = ___.  
Subsequent pathology returned showing negative margins.  
Patient completed an 8 day course of IV antibiotics per ID.  Of 
note, MRI foot also showed abnormalities ___ the ___ and ___ R 
toes, that were felt to likely be reactive to recent trauma 
that patient reported (although infection could not be ruled 
out).  Podiatry recommended outpatient follow-up with 
consideration of reimaging to ensure resolution.  Discharged 
with 3 day supply of prn oxycodone.  

# Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
: Patient with significant anxiety during admission, greater 
than baseline. Medications confirmed with her psychiatrist, Dr. 
___, ___ ___. She was continued on Bupropion, BusPIRone, 
fluoxetine

# Gout 
Continued Allopurinol 

# Chronic CHF NOS
Continued bumetanide, sprinolactone, metoprolol

# Type 2 diabetes 
Continued glargine, humalog sliding scale and bydureon. 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
=====================
- Patient discharged with follow up with podiatry for wound 
healing and evaluation for new ulcers. 
- Would consider ensuring patient follow up with outpatient 
psych for management of anxiety, which seems to have a 
significant impact on her life
