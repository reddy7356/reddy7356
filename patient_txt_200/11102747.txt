Imaging:
___ CXR: Frontal and lateral views of the chest are 
obtained. There are small-to-moderate bilateral pleural 
effusions with overlying atelectasis.  Anterolateral right 
pleural thickening is again seen. Surgical clips are noted 
projecting over the right lower hemithorax/right upper quadrant. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. IMPRESSION: 
Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis. 

___ CT torso: 1. Loculated right pleural effusion with 
peripheral calcifications, similar in appearance to prior study. 
Small left pleural effusion is increased since the 
abdomen/pelvis CT of ___. Increased bibasilar opacities 
may relate to worsening atelectasis, although infection and/or 
aspiration not excluded. 2. Persistent retroesophageal 
lymphadenopathy. Mediastinal and retroperitoneal 
lymphadenopathy, non-specific, but metastatic involvement cannot 
be excluded; findings are similar to that on the prior study. 3. 
Multiple known hepatic lesions, not optimally assessed on this 
single-phase study, but as described above. Hepatic cirrhosis 
and moderate to large amount of ascites. Areas of peritoneal 
enhancement/thickening, as also seen previously, although may 
have increased since the prior study. Findings may be 
reactive/post-inflammatory, although infectious or malignant 
ascites is not excluded. 
4. Apparent mild thickening of the wall of the ascending colon, 
could relate to portal colopathy or reactive from ascites, 
although colitis (infectious, ischemic, or inflammatory) is not 
entirely excluded. No pneumatosis or free air is seen. No bowel 
obstruction. 5. Mild right hydronephrosis of uncertain etiology. 
6. Destructive right iliac bone lesion with soft tissue 
component, highly worrisome for metastatic disease. 7. Mild 
compression of the superior endplate of the L1 vertebral body, 
new since ___, but of otherwise indeterminate age.

___ Bone scan:
1. Heterogeneous tracer uptake in the area of the lytic, 
destructive lesion in the right iliac bone seen on the recent CT 
is concerning for a metastasis. 
2. Two foci of mildly increased tracer uptake in the left ___ 
and ___ anterolateral ribs correspond with sclerotic foci and 
mild rib contour abnormalities on recent CT, more consistent 
with post-traumatic changes.  
3. Linear focus of increased tracer uptake at the superior 
endplate of L1 corresponds with the compression fracture seen on 
CT.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
In summary this ___ man with history of HCV cirrhosis 
c/b esophageal varices and ascites and multifocal HCC s/p 
cyberknife and TACE presented with fevers and chills after a 
recent 2 week hospitalization for variceal bleed c/b hypotension 
and renal failure in ___. He was found on admission to have 
a urinary tract infection, bacteremia, and spontaneous bacterial 
peritonitis.

# Fever - bacteremia and urinary tract infection: He was found 
to have a Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection. The 
Klebsiella was sensitive to amikacin and meropenem and resistent 
to all other abx (see resistance patterns above) - an ESBL 
bacteria. On the second hospital day, blood cultures (___) were 
also growing the same Klebsiella species. The patient was 
treated initially with Zosyn; he defervesced and clinically 
improved with this treatment, despite the fact that culture 
sensitivities later showed resistence to Zosyn. When the 
sensitivities returned, the patient was switched to meropenem. 
Blood cultures have now cleared on three consecutive days of 
surveillance cultures, and a PICC line has been placed in the 
left arm. Placement of the PICC was confirmed radiographically, 
and it is ready for use.

The antibiotic course will be completed on ___. This will 
complete a 14-day course of meropenem treatment for bacteremia. 
Following this, the patient should be transitioned to 
ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis 
(see below).

# Culture negative neutrophilic ascites: A diagnostic 
paracentesis performed at the time of admission was consistent 
with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (ie. absolute neutrophil 
count >250/mL). The LDH was slightly elevated (52), and the 
total protein was low (0.9), all consistent with spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis. However, peritoneal fluid cultures 
remained negative during the entirety of this admission. A 
repeated paracentesis performed on the third hospital day showed 
much decreased neutrophils (<10/mL), which suggests that there 
was some response to antibiotic therapy; it is possible that the 
SBP was partially treated at time of admission as patient was 
taking ciprofloxacin prior to admission, a medicine that he had 
received since his hospitalization in ___ two weeks ago for 
variceal bleed. For this reason, we are recommending that the 
patient continue prophylaxis for SBP after he finishes his 
course of meropenem. Notably, the second paracentesis was large 
volume (2L), and the patient was treated afterwards with 25 gm 
of intravenous albumin. Fluid from this second paracentesis was 
sent for cytology, given our concern of metastatic 
hepatocellular cancer, and this will need to be followed up 
after discharge (see below).

# Hepatocellular carcinoma: He is s/p cyberknife and TACE 
treatments. Recently his case was discussed at tumor board with 
plans for close observation given his increasing AFP but no 
clear liver lesions to target for treatment. CT scan from this 
admission revealed a new lesion in the right iliac bone; this 
was followed up with a bone scan, also suggestive of malignant 
disease in the right ilium (see full reports above). The images 
were reviewed with radiology. The patient was never complaining 
of pain in the hips or back, even with ambulation, and the 
decision was made to follow the lesion conservatively with 
repeat imaging in one to two months. The patient will see his 
outpatient oncologist in one to two weeks. An AFP is pending at 
time of discharge. *The lytic right iliac lesion was discussed 
with patient, and he agrees with the plan for now for active 
surveillance.

# Bilateral pleural effusions: Likely a contributing cause of 
his cough and SOB. He was given a large volume of crystalloid 
and colloid per his report when he was hospitalized in ___. 
He has an element of diastolic dysfunction with an EF of >55% in 
___. Once he clinically stabilized, his home diuretics were 
resumed. His furosemide dose was increased from 40 mg twice 
daily to 60 mg twice daily. Spironolactone dose remains the 
same. The patient should take two more days of potassium 
supplement due to the increased dose of Lasix. This course will 
complete on ___.
  
# Acute kidney injury: This was most likely a result of his SBP. 
His creatinine continued to improve with antibiotics and 
albumin. In addition, his CT showed evidence of right 
hydronephrosis without evidence of mass or stone. The images 
were reviewed with radiology. This finding may be a result of 
peristalsis with CT scan catching a transient hydronephrosis, or 
a result of an acute angle of the ureter. It is possible that 
inflammatory changes from SBP resulted in further strain and 
angling of the ureter, thus causing a transient hydronephrosis. 
His spironolactone and lasix were held until creatinine 
improved, and then they were resumed. His renal function was at 
baseline at time of discharge.
  
# HCV cirrhosis: He has known esophageal varices and ascites and 
recently underwent emergent variceal banding in ___ (___). 
He was continued on nadolol, with a plan for repeat EGD in three 
weeks. His diuretics are as above. He can continue to take 
lactulose as needed for constipation, although there is no 
documented history of encephalopathy.

# Diabetes mellitus, non-insulin dependent: He was continued on 
___ and ISS while inpatient. His home glipizide and metformin 
can be resumed after discharge.

# Code Status: During this admission, the patient was confirmed 
full code.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ a ___ M with history of ESLD ___ Hep C cirrhosis 
c/b ascites, esophageal varices (Grade 2) s/p UGIB in ___ 
s/p banding, ___ s/p TACE in ___, ___ transferred from 
OSH for hypoglycemia, was initially being aggressively diuresed, 
which has slowed down now secondary to his low blood pressures 
and electrolyte abnormalities.
.
# ESLD ___ HCV Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of ESLD 
complicated by ascites, SBP, varices s/p UGIB in ___.  His 
LFTs are currently consistent with recent baseline. Patient now 
with bilateral pleural effusions suggesting worsening of liver 
failure.  The patient was initially started on IV lasix to 
enhance his diueresis and the patient responded with good urine 
output.  However, because of electrolyte abnormalities and the 
patient's baseline low blood pressures (in the low ___ Lasix 
was held.  The patient's spironolactone was also reduced to 50 
mg BID, as well.  An attempt was made for paracentesis, however, 
enough fluid for only a diagnositic para was obtained.  The 
patient was negative for SBP on tap. He was continued on his 
Cipro prophylaxis treatment while in patient.  He was also 
continued on omeprazole, and ursodiol.  The patient also had 
episodes of lethargy during this admission, which is most likely 
due to hepatic encephalopathy.  Because of this, we started him 
on a regimen of lactulose/rifaxamin with some improvement of his 
mental status.  The patient was also continued on his nadolol 20 
mg; however, it was held frequently given his low blood 
pressures.  Attempts should be made for him to continue the 
nadolol given his history of varices, however, should be held if 
his systolic blood pressure are below 90.
.
# hypotension:  The patient has baseline low blood pressures; 
during this admission his systolic pressures have been stably in 
the mid80s-high ___.  He has been entirely asymptomatic and 
comfortable with these pressures.  The patient's Lasix is being 
held upon discharge, but he will be continued on his 
Spironolactone 50 mg BID.  The patient will also be discharged 
on his nadolol; however, holding parameters will be including 
given his hypotension. 
.
# ___: The patient is s/p cyberknife and TACE treatment and has 
a fairly poor prognosis and is a candidate for hospice care at 
this point.  The patient, however, is not ready for hospice 
care.  He is scheduled for outpatient oncology and liver follow 
up.
.  
# goals of care:  The patient is reluctant to transition to 
hospice care.  He has clear understanding of his prognosis, but 
does not think that he is at the point for hospice yet.  He is 
mentally intact, able to make decisions on his own.  Does not 
demonstrate any confusion, but has been noted to be slightly 
more lethargic.  He demonstrated episodes of somnolence during 
this admission, likely hepatic encephalopathy from his ESLD.  We 
attempted multiple discussions about goals of care with the 
patient but he is not very open to discussing it, often 
deferring to his primary hepatologist or his daughter.  A goals 
of care discussion was initiated with his daughter, who is the 
health care proxy because of this, as well as because he was 
starting to develop the tendency to wax and wane with his mental 
status.  After a long discussion, decision was made that patient 
will be DNR/DNI with no escalation of medical care.  The patient 
seems a lot more accepting of the notion of hospice now as 
compared to when he was first admitted, but a goals of care 
discussion needs to be readdressed in the near future.  He has 
good insight into his illness, but it not quite ready to accept 
the terminal stage of his disease.  Currently plans are to go 
for rehabilitation with plans for transitioning to hospice care 
in the future.
.
# ESBL bacteruria: The patient has history of ESBL bacteruria 
(___), and is currently without any symptoms.  The patient 
urine culture from this admission grew out Klebsiella that was 
sensitive to Bactrim.  Because the patient was asymptomatic, he 
was not treated as it is most likely a colonizer.
.  
# Anemia: The patient's hematocrit was 32 on admission and is 
24.5 on discharge, likely slow GI bleed either from his varices 
or from his liver lesions.  At OSH, the patient had an endoscopy 
that showed duodenitis, nonbleeding esophageal ulcer, and 
esophageal varices.  He was transfused 2U PRBC at the OSH before 
transfer to ___. The patient never had an acute crit drop 
while at ___ and he was never transfused.  Because of his 
history of upper GI bleeding and esophageal varices, a crit goal 
of 25 is ideal.  Please continue to follow his crit as an 
outpatient.  If his hematocrit drops below ___, would 
seriously consider having another goals of conversation with the 
patient and his family regarding if he would like to transition 
to hospice care, rather than reflexively readmitting to the 
hospital.
.  
# Hyperkalemia: The patient was initially hyperkalemic on 
admission, likey due to his spironolactone.  During the 
hospitalization, his K was trended, and eventually normalized.
.  
# Hyponatremia: The patient was hyponatremic during this 
admission, which sodium going as low as 127, likely due to his 
diuretic therapy.  The patient was fluid restricted and his 
lasix was held, to which his hyponatremia slowly improved.  At 
discharge, the patient's sodium was 130.
.  
# DM: The patient was found to be hypoglycemic at OSH because he 
took his lantus dose without eating dinner. The patient was 
restarted on Lantus 10 u as inpatient, as well as sliding scale. 
 At discharge his normal home dose of lantus was restarted (20 u 
qhs).
..
Transitional issues:
.
# goals of care: The patient needs to have his goals of care 
readdressed.  During this admission, the patient was reluctant 
to turn to hospice care.  He has good insight into his condition 
and his poor prognosis, but is not willing to take the step 
towards hospice.  Multiple discussions were already undertaken 
with patient and two daughters, but this issue needs to be 
readdressed as outpatient.  The patient was made DNR/DNI, as per 
HCP.
.
# hematocrit: The patient's hct was trending down during this 
admission, likely from slow GI bleed from varices or portal 
gastropathy, or from bleeding hepatocellular carcinoma tumors.  
Please continue to follow his hematocrit.  If his hematocrit 
drops below ___, would seriously consider having another goals 
of conversation with the patient and his family regarding if he 
would like to transition to hospice care, rather than 
reflexively readmitting to the hospital.
.
# hypotension: The patient's blood pressures were running low 
this admission (in the mid___-high ___ likely due to both his 
cirrhosis and diuretic therapy.  We held the patient's lasix at 
discharge and reduced his spironlactone dose to 50 mg BID.
.
# electroytes: please continue to follow sodium and potassium; 
if sodium levels trend down, consider fluid restriction.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were hospitalized 
at ___.  You were admitted to the hospital because you were 
having worsening lower extremity edema and also had low blood 
sugars at an outside hospital.  By the time you got to this 
hospital, your blood sugars normalized and we restarted you on 
Lantus and your insulin sliding scale.

While you were here, we also gave you some medications through 
your veins to get extra water off of you.  However, because your 
blood pressures were very low, we had to hold some of your 
diuretic medication.  Your blood pressures were running on the 
low side while in the hospital, because of your liver disease, 
as well as the medications we were using to get extra fluid out 
of your belly and legs.  We tried to use a needle to drain the 
extra fluid out of your belly, but we did not get a lot off.
.
While you were in the hospital we also had conversations about 
your goals of care with you and your daughters.  You are very 
sick and we think your healthcare should shift more towards 
making sure that you are comfortable.  We think it is very 
important that you address these issues with Dr. ___ your 
oncology doctors as ___ outpatient.

We made the following changes to your medications:
STOP Lasix 60 mg in the morning, 40 mg in the evening

check on pt who was sleeping when his life alert bracelet went 
off, instructing him to check his BP.  When daughter tried to 
wake up the patient for BP check, she states he was "completely 
out of it."  He was able to try to communicate with her, but had 
significant difficulty and appeared weak, trying to say he 
"couldn't" get the BP cuff on.  Daughter called ambulance and pt 
was transported to OSH where BG was found to be 28.

OSH COURSE: ___ BG of 28 by EMT. He was given glucagon and
