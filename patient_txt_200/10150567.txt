1. Large fecal loading of the colon with significant impaction 
of stool in the 
rectosigmoid.  Chronic thickening of the distal colon. 
2. Nonvisualized appendix though no secondary signs of 
appendicitis. 
3. Limited exam due to motion and suboptimal patient positioning 


 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with MR, blindness, EDS, hypertension, and chronic 
constipation p/w nausea and vomiting, loose stools, and 
leukocytosis with radiographic evidence of large stool burden 
and chronic colitis, found to be hypotensive on presentation.

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE:
==============
# Hypotension: Patient presented initially with SBP ___, 
which were initially not fluid responsive with 4L, thus was sent 
to the MICU. Differential was hypovolemia in the setting of 
vomiting and diarrhea vs. sepsis given leukocytosis and GI 
symptoms in the setting of large stool burden. He may also have 
had a vagal response from abdominal distention and constipation. 
He improved with IV fluid resuscitation, with SBPs of 100-120 
when transferred from ICU. He was empirically covered for 
infection with ceftriaxone and flagyl. Patient transferred to 
floors with SBP at 108 and stable. At time of discharge, pt was 
deemed stable. Hypotension etiology is dehydration vs. 
superimposed sepsis given elevated WBC (although pt remained 
afebrile, regular rate). 

#Leukocytosis: WBC count was high to 20.4 with 80% PMNs. This 
may have been reactive from constipation and colitis vs. C. diff 
or infectious gastroenteritis. CXR was without evidence of 
pneumonia. His c.diff assay was negative. He was initially 
covered broadly with vancomycin/cefepime/flagyl, then 
transitioned to ceftriaxone and flagyl for broad abdominal 
organism coverage, given improvement of leukocytosis on 
antibiotics. Pt's WBC was 6.9 at time of discharge.

# Constipation with chronic colitis: Acute on chronic with 
evidence of impaction on CT. He had a large bowel movement with 
enema and was disimpacted. Pt improved symptomatically. Pt also 
was started on a senna/Colace/miralax regimen which helped. 
Patient is to continue these bowel regimens to ensure 2 regular 
bowel movements a day.

# ___: Cr at admission up to 1.4 from baseline of 1.1-1.2. This 
was likely hypovolemic as improved with fluid resuscitation. 

# Hypertension: Held home enalapril in setting of hypotension. A 
message was left for pt's PCP ___ whether 
enalapril would be restarted. For the time being, instructions 
to HOLD the enalapril was given to the group home where patient 
stays given that he has been Hypotensive on current and previous 
admission.s.

# Anemia: Baseline ___, Macrocytic. His CBC downtrended 
likely due to fluid resuscitation, was stable on transfer out of 
ICU and continued to be stable on the floors.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with a past medical history of 
seizure disorder and MR who presents with BRBPR

# BRBPR: likely lower GI bleed, possibly diverticular given 
history of chornic constipation; however, it is impossible to 
say the exact etiology.  He remained hemodynamically stable with 
a stable Hct. He has had prior colonoscopy attempts, but without 
good prep and given his Fe Def anemia of unknown etiology, it 
would be prudent to get a good bowel prep and look for an occult 
source of bloos loss. After consulting GI, we attempted such 
with  2 days of prep with MoviPrep, Lactulose, Mag Citrate, 2 
tap water enemas and multiple oral medications; however, we were 
still unable to get a good prep. KUB not concerning for 
obstruction. After dicussing with the family, they elected not 
to continue with another day of prep, but instead to employ 
watchful waiting and bring him back should he have another GI 
bleed. 
We maintained TxS, PIV access, trended his H&H, and monitored 
his vitals. 

He will be discharged with GI and PCP ___.  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-Monitor CBC at follow up appointment. 
-Adjust bowel regimen as needed for constipation
-Consider outpt colonoscopy 
-BP med held ___ to GI bleed on admission and he remined 110s 
throughout admission, thus ACEi held at discharge. Restart as 
needed per PCP. 

Billing: Greater than 30 minutes were spent coordinating Mr 
___ discharge from the hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,

You came to us with bright red bleeding from your bottom. Here 
you were stable and your blood levels were only slightly low, 
which stabilized and began to rise within 24 hours of admission. 
Our GI doctors  saw ___ and decided a colonoscopy would be best, 
however, we were unable to get a good bowel prep. You decided 
that since you had no additional bleeds, that your blood levels 
arestable, and that your vital signs remained stable, a 
colonoscopy is not emergently needed; however, we still do not 
know the reason you had a bleed and one reason could be a polyp 
or a cancer. You will follow up in GI clinic and with your PCP 
for further care. Should this happen again, please come to the 
ER immediately. 

We wish you all the best,
Your ___ Team.

STUDIES/IMAGING: None
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with history of seizure disorder and mental retardation who 
presents with complaints of fever.    

#Fever - patient had fever 2 days prior to admission however 
remained without fever on admission and no localizing signs of 
infection. CXR was deferred at request of patiets mother/HCP as 
no symptoms/signs of respiratory infection and felt would 
aggitate patient further. If patient continues to spike fever, 
then informed patient's mother to make another follow up 
appointment with PCP to determine if patient has developed any 
localizing signs of infection.  It is likely that patient's 
fever was secondary to viral syndrome which resolved without any 
intervention. 

#Hypotension - patient with systolic blood pressures in the ___ 
on admission which improved to SBP of 104 at the time of 
discharge with IVF.  We discontinued patient's blood pressure 
medication Enalapril and HCTZ.  These medications may be 
retarted as outpatient if needed. We encouraged patient's mother 
to have him drink plenty of fluid to keep him hydrated.  His 
mother will make a follow up appointment with ___ for blood 
pressure check either this week or next week. 

#Leukocytosis: Pt with wbc ct of 15.9 on admission, no bands or 
atypicals on diff. Completed workup for infection as above. 
Trended down to WNL at time of discharge.

___: Cr 1.2 on admission from normal baseline. Likely pre-renal 
in setting of decreased PO intake from ? infection above. 
Received 1L IVF in ED. As above, encouraged further PO intake as 
outpatient. Also held HCTZ and ACE-Inhibitor.

CHRONIC MEDICAL ISSUES:  

#Seizure d/o: currently not on any anti-epileptics. Has not had 
seizure in long period per mother. 

#Mental retardion: pt non-verbal at baseline and became agitated 
in the ED. Given Ativan and eventually calmed down when reached 
medicine floor. 

#Chronic constipaton: continued home regimen of miralax, senna 
and docusate  

#HTN: held HCTZ and enalapril given mild ___ and hypotension. 
Not restarted at D/C as patient was normotensive. Will need to 
continue to monitor BPs and follow up with PCP to determine if 
can restart HCTZ and ACE-Inhibitor. 

#Seasonal allergies: continued home loratadine  

#GERD: continued home omeprazole  

#Iron deficiency anemia: h/h on admission 10.2/30.2, which is 
less than most recent values however close to baseline from 
___. Pt has been seen by Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. There 
has been a discussion about need for colonoscopy in future to 
assess ___. No evidence of weight loss per mother or change in 
bowel habits immediately concerning for malignancy. Continued 
iron supplements this admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

#Fever - patient had fever 2 days prior to admission, however 
remained without fever on admission and no localizing signs of 
infection. CXR was deferred at request of patiets mother/HCP as 
no symptoms/signs of respiratory infection and felt would 
aggitate patient further. If patient continues to spike fever, 
consider good oral exam given hx of swelling/edema of cheek 1 
week prior to admission and consider empiric treatment for 
possible pneumonia. 

#BP - patient with systolic blood pressures in the ___ this 
admission that resolved with IVF to 100s systolic, but stable HR 
and per mother patient appears at his baseline. Encouraged PO 
intake of fluids. Also asked patient to hold home ACE-Inhibitor 
and HCTZ at discharge. These can be restarted by PCP if needed.
