Mr. ___, 

You were admitted to the hospital with a perirectal abscess. You

this abscess and placement of drain in the area. The abscess is 
quite large and will require irrigation of this drain to heal. 
The drain will stay inplace until your follow-up appointment. 
Please irrigate this drain with 30cc of sterile normal saline as 
instructed by the nursing staff. Please use a mirror to assess 
this area for worsened signs of infection: increased redness, 
increased drainage of green/white/thick foul smelling drainage, 
increased swelling of the tissue around the abscess. Please call 
if the wound is putting out bright red blood. A small amount of 
pussy/light pink drainage is normal, we want the area to drain. 
You should where a dry gauze pad in your underwear to catch the 
drainage and you should change this at least daily and ideally 
after each drain flush. Please take the antibiotic Augmentin for 
7 days, please take this entire prescription.

questions or concerns.
