___
CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: A nodule in the left apex (2:14) 
measuring 14 mm has increased in size. There is scarring and 
chain suture at the left apex 
related to prior wedge resection, which appears stable. There is 
minimal 
bibasilar dependent atelectasis. No other masses or nodules are 
seen. No 
pleural effusion is present. Airways appear patent to the 
segmental levels 
bilaterally. Target lesion #1 in the mediastinum measuring 9 x 6 
mm (2:16) 
has slightly decreased in size. Target lesion #2 in the 
mediastinum (2:20) 
measuring 13 x 3 mm is unchanged. Target lesion #3 (2:18) in the 
mediastinum measuring 8 x 5 mm is unchanged. No significant 
axillary, hilar, or mediastinal adenopathy is present. 

CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Status post right nephrectomy and 
adrenalectomy 
with multiple surgical clips in the renal fossa. No evidence for 
suspicious nodules in the resection bed. There is a hypodensity 
in the left kidney, which is likely a simple cyst but is 
incompletely characterized on this study. Otherwise, the left 
kidney appears normal without stones, masses, or hydronephrosis. 
The spleen, left adrenal, gallbladder, liver appear normal. The 
pancreas is fatty replaced but is otherwise normal. Abdominal 
aorta and its branches appear widely patent. Stomach and 
abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal. No free air or no 
free fluid is seen. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy 
is present. 

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There are colonic diverticula 
particularly at the 
sigmoid colon without evidence for diverticulitis. Otherwise, 
pelvic loops of small and large bowel appear normal. Appendix 
appears normal. No free air or no free fluid is seen. Bladder 
and uterus appear normal. Adjacent to the left iliac artery 
(2:90) is a heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass measuring 
3.5 x 3.5 cm which has increased in size compared to the prior 
study. Anterior and invading into the left sacrum is a 6.2 x 5.4 
cm mass which has appreciably increased in size compared to the 
prior study. No evidence for bowel obstruction. There is a 
fat-containing ventral hernia (2:75). No bowel loops are seen in 
this hernia. 
  
BONE AND SOFT TISSUE WINDOWS: Vertebral fusion hardware spans 
from T10 to L3 with bilateral pedicle screws at T10, T11, T12, 
L2 and L3. Unchanged loss of vertebral body height at L1. No new 
bony metastatic disease is seen at that site; however, 
evaluation is somewhat limited due to extensive streak artifact 
from fusion hardware. In the posterior aspect of the left iliac 
wing (2:74 through 2:80) is a soft tissue density measuring 6.1 
x 3.3 cm, which may be a hematoma or seroma secondary to bone 
graft harvesting. Surrounding this soft tissue density are 
amorphous areas of calcification which may represent areas of 
dystrophic calcification secondary to bone harvest. This is 
unlikely to represent an area of metastatic disease; however, 
attention should be paid on followup. 
  
PELVIS U.S., TRANSVAGINAL ___
IMPRESSION: 
1. Enlarged endometrium in this postmenopausal patient, warrants 
further 
evaluation as discussed with ___ APN on the day of 
the study. 
2. Large left adnexal nodal mass, better seen on CT from the 
same date. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted to the surgical floor, she was started on 
Vancomycin and continued on Keflex. A torso CT was done at the 
request of her oncologist please see results section for further 
detail.  During her first hospital day she passed a large golf 
ball size clot from her vagina, GYN was consulted they 
recommended a pelvic ultrasound and this showed an enlarged 
endometrium whcih warrents futher follow-up out-pt. She was 
taken to the OR on ___ where she had a wound revision/flap by 
plastic & neurosurgery. She tolerated the surgery well and then 
had a PICC placed on ___ due to the need for Ampicillin 2G q4hr 
for 4weeks and Flagyl 500mg PO q8 for 6weeks for positive 
C-diff. She was required to have weekly ALT, AST, Tbili, Alk 
Phos, CBC with diff results faxed to Dr. ___

IMPRESSION: Unchanged bilateral pulmonary metastases. No acute 
process 
identified. 
.
___ Left femoral reamings
1.  Fragments of bone and bone marrow with maturing trilineage 
hematopiesis, no evidence of malignancy; multiple levels are 
examined, see note.
2.  Fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle.
.
___ Intraop Films
28 spot fluoroscopic images were obtained intraoperatively 
without the 
presence of a radiologist. Flouro time recorded as 533.1 s on 
the 
electronic requisition. Views demonstrate steps related to 
fixation of a 
distal femoral shaft fracture. FCorrelaiton with real-time 
findings and,when appropriate, conventional radiographs is 
recommended for full assessment. 
.
___ CTA Chest
IMPRESSION: 
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. 
2. Interval progression of metastatic disease since ___ with 
increase in the size and number of metastatic foci. 
3. Interval development of pulmonary edema and small bilateral 
pleural 
effusion. 
.
___ Femur Right
The film is listed as two views of the femur. However, the study 
consists of a single view of the femur and a single view of the 
right lower extremity. The right hip and proximal femoral neck 
are not well evaluated on this scan. No acute fracture is 
detected on this limited exam. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic 
lesions are detected. 
Some non-aggressive periosteal new bone seen in the proximal 
tibial diaphysis medially likely relates to a muscle insertion 
site. However, if this corresponds to the site of symptoms, then 
conventional AP and lateral views of the right lower extremity 
or alternatively an MRI scan would be recommended for further 
assessment. There are degenerative changes of the right knee. 
.
___
Bilateral LENIs: There is nonocclusive thrombus of some age in 
one of the left posterior tibial veins. The other deep veins of 
the lower extremities show no ultrasound evidence of deep venous 
thrombosis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma. She underwent an ORIF on ___. Her post-operative 
course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and 
hypotension.

vein deep vein thrombosis. It was unclear how long the blood 
clot had been there (chronic or new). 
Patient was started on Lovenox (therapeutic dosing) and given 
her hemoptysis, closely monitored. Patient did not have any 
issues with increased bleeding on Lovenox. 
- Continue Lovenox ___ q12 daily 
.  
# Hemoptysis: On ___ and ___ Ms. ___ had an episode of 
hemoptysis. Each episode was approximately 1 teaspoon. Pulmonary 
was consulted who felt this was likely related to known 
pulmonary metastatic disease in the presence of lovenox for DVT 
prophylaxis. Patient did benefit from 2L nasal cannula at night, 
more for OSA. Ultimately, patient's lovenox had to be increased 
to therapeutic doses given her left lower extremity DVT. She did 
not have any hemoptysis for >48 hours, however, prior to 
discharge - with close supervision. 
- Continue 2L nasal cannula at night, room air during the day 
- Continue Lovenox at DVT treatment dosing 
.

on ___ at 10:40am (for Ortho Xrays on ___ ___ ___) and 
11am (w/ ___, NP)
- Please encourage patient to continue working with physical 
therapy. She should get extra pain medications as needed 
prior/during work with physical therapy. 
.
# Pain Control: The pain service was consulted to help manage 
Ms. ___ pain. She was started on nortriptyline and 
increased morphine. Nortriptyline was eventually stopped given 
some concerns for tremor and weakness in her upper extremities. 
Patient was started on gabapentin, MS ___ up to 
90mg TID) and lidocaine patches with control of her pain.
- Continue Morphine Sulfate ___ ___ every 4 hours for 
breakthrough pain 
- Continue MS ___ 90mg TID for ongoing pain (can decrease to 
90/60/90mg if overly sedated) 
- Continue gabapentin and lidocaine patches - the latter has 
been particularly helpful in controlling patient's pain
.  
#. Atrial fibrillation: Her post-operative course was 
complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR and hypotension. She 
required care in the SICU. Cardiology was consulted. She was 
loaded with digoxin and converted into a regular rate. She 
maintained a regular rate throughout the rest of the 
hospitalization. She was placed on metoprolol TID.
- Continue current metoprolol TID dose
.  
#. Delirium: Post-op course complicated by delirium. This 
resolved outside of the ICU.
- Continue lorazepam PRN for anxiety and before bed to help with 
sleep
.  
#. Metastatic renal cell: Ms. ___ is s/p 
nephrectomy/adrenalectomy, spinal tumor resection/T9-L2 fusion, 
and left ORIF on ___. A family meeting was held on ___ which 
discussed her ___ plans. She will restart her Sutent 
after allowing a couple of weeks for her fracture to heal. 
Patient does also have a number of metastasis to her skin (left 
flank purplish nodules), confirmed by biopsy pathology reports.
.  
# Hypothyroidism: Continue home dose of levothyroxine.  
.  
# Skin Nodules: Per review of path reports, she has nodules on 
her back which were consistent with known metastatic disease.   
.  
# Oxygen Saturation: Desaturates slightly when sleeping. Likely 
due to obstructive sleep apnea.
