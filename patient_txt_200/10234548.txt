Imaging:
___ CXR:  Pneumomediastinum.  Possible small right ptx. 
Extensive subcutaneous emphysema, particularly of the shoulders 
and neck.

c/w atelectasis.  L brachiocephalic CVL passing across chest 
into L brachiocephalic vein. 
___ CT head:  No IC hemorrhage or mass effect. Extensive soft 
tissue emphysema of the neck which traverses fascial planes
___ CT c-spine: No cervical spine fracture or malalignment. 
Extensive subcutaneous and intramuscular emphysema throughout 
the anterior neck which extends through fascial planes to 
involve the prevertebral, masticator, and carotid spaces as well 
as superior anterior mediastinum. The sites of penetrating 
trauma are difficult to define given extent of emphysema. No 
discrete hematoma is seen. Small biapical pneumothoraces.

earlier in day

opacity in L mid lung. 
___: CXR - (post WS) No PTX.  RM lung opacity unchanged.  
Additional clearing in RUL, stable density LLL. No change in NGT 
and trach position. Better aeration L mid lung.
___: CT neck/chest-Air collections-post-cricoid region/proximal 
esophagus to R of midline, retropharyngeal space inferiorly into 
the posterior superior mediastinum w/ air and soft tissue 
density-mediastinitis. rim- enhancing collection in the 
posterior and right 
superior mediastinum ? abscess.
___: CXR-Patchy areas of opacification could well represent 
pulmonary contusion or postoperative atelectasis. CVL placed.
___: CT neck/chest - soft tissue swelling, gas in the 
prevertebral space, no fluid collect. Locules of gas in the 
mediastinum c/w mediastinitis. no drainable collect. Liver lac.
___: CT c/a/p - no signif change from 1 day ago.  Extensive 
mediastinal inflammatory change with fluid and gas with 
mediastinal drain in place and no drainable fluid collection.  
Unchanged extensive pneumonia of lower lobes bilaterally. 
Unchanged hepatic lacerations with layering hematoma.  No 
intra-abd or pelvic abscess
