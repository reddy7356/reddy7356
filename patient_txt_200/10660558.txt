MR head ___
FINDINGS: Extremely limited study. The ventricles and sulci are 
prominent, 
suggestive of age-related volume loss. No other findings can be 
made from 
this nondiagnostic study. The patient was immediately referred 
to CT 
angiogram.

Echo: 
Conclusions  
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, 
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal 
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion 
are normal. There is abnormal septal motion/position. An aortic 
___ prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis 
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and 
transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic regurgitation and a very 
small paravalvular leak are seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The 
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Well-seated, normally functioning aortic ___ 
prosthesis with trace aortic regurgitation and a very small 
paravalvular leak. Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall 
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular 
systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar. Previously, the very small aortic 
paravalvular leak was not commented upon, but appears to have 
been present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine Course:
___ yo F with CAD s/p CABG in ___ (LIMA to LAD, SVG to D2, SVG 
to dRCA and SVG to OM), interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, DM, 
HTN, HLD, with progressive dyspnea on exertion, admitted for 
___ palcement. 
.
# Aortic stenosis: Patient has critical aortic stenosis with 
most recent valve area measurement of 0.7 cm2. She is currently 
showing symptoms of dyspnea on minimal exertion. Patient deemed 
"extreme risk" for surgical aortic valve replacement. Patient 
admitted for ___ placement.
.
# Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis: New diagnosis for patient, 
but likely long-standing. Dyspnea on exertion is at least 
particially due to pulmonary disease. Recent CT chest showed 
severe diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and marked restrictive 
ventilatory defect on PFTs. Did not require oxygen at baseline. 
Patient continued on home albuterol inhaler and Advair. 
.
# Coronary artery disease: Longstanding, s/p CABG in ___ (LIMA 
to LAD, SVG to D2, SVG to dRCA and SVG to OM), which on recent 
cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease. Patient 
currently asymptomatic.
.  
# Diabetes: Patient only on glyburide at home, which was held. 
Patient placed on Humalog sliding scale.

Cardiac Surgery Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room on ___ where she 
underwent ___ placement with Dr. ___ Dr. ___.  
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for observation and recovery.  Shortly following 
arrival in ___, the patient developed cardiac arrest requiring 
re-intubation and resuscitation.  Echo revealed free air in the 
right atrium and ventricles.  She also developed rapid atrial 
fibrillation and eventually converted to SR with electrical and 
chemical cardioversion.  Transvenous wire was placed on ___ at 
the bedside by Dr. ___ second degree heart block.  The 
patient developed a fever.  Sputum cultures would grow 
Pseudomonas.  The patient was treated with appropriate 
antibiotics.  
When the patient was weaned from sedation, she was unable to 
move the left upper extremity. Neurology was consulted for 
evaluation and she was confirmed to have a CVA. Eventually 
extubated on ___. Swallowing eval done and she had 
confusion. Supportive care given while she remained in the CVICU 
for monitoring. 
Now alert and oriented and following commands. Aphasia resolved 
and LUE remains as the only deficit. Transferred to the floor on 
POD # 18. Cleared for discharge to ___ in 
___ on POD #19. Follow up appts were advised.
