History of Present Illness:
Ms ___ is a ___ year female with history of 
___ disease who presents with diffuse weakness, fatigue 
and dysarthria.  

Reports memory of this AM is a little hazy; had difficulty 
waking up, speach therapist came by for the first time to 
evaluate patient, noted her to be very lethargic and acutely 
increased stuttering/sluring of speach from already abnormal 
baseline, OT who regularly sees her came by soon after, 
concerned, took her BP and noted it to be 64/40, and so EMS was 
called.

Patient reports progressive fatigue over the past several months 
as well as worsened speach (decreased volume, increased 
stuttering/sluring of words). She has also had several recent 
admissions ___, ___) for labile BPs 
(either hypotensive to a similar degree, or hypertensive with 
SBPs in 200s) and fatigue/lethargy, similar to today. Somewhat 
recently was started on fludricortisone by someone (unsure if it 
was PCP or if it was started during a recent hospitalization) to 
help with her labile blood pressures. Unsure if she carries a 
diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. 

Denies specific infectious symptoms; no fevers/chills, no URI 
symptoms, no h/a, no vision changes, no cough, no CP, no SOB, no 
abd pain, no N/V/D, no dysuria. Does report various intermittent 
joint pains over the past few weeks (her left shoulder, left 
elbow, right foot) of brief duration. Also notes "bruising" over 
hands/feet which is transitent - unable to describe this skin 
finding further. Has been taking good PO, reports conciously 
trying to stay hydrated as she has been told she was dehydrated 
on previous admissions. 

Still feels very weak despite IV fluids and improvement in her 
BP. Some slight low back pain, but denies chest pain, shortness 
of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, fever, cough. 

EMS vitals: Pulse:  90   BP:  110/60   RR:  16   SpO2%:  95 RA. 
In the ED, initial VS were 97.6 93 104/55 20 99% RA. Received 1L 
NS and caradopa/levadopa. Cultues sent. CXR unremarkable. 
Patient had difficulty urinating, required straight cathing. 
Transfer VS were 93 166/95 18 98% RA. 

On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling fatigued, but 
otherwise back to her baseline. Reports mental status has 
cleared, speach is back to her previous baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ is a ___ year female with history of 
___ disease who presents with diffuse weakness, fatigue 
and dysarthria.

ACTIVE ISSUES: 
=========
# Weakness/Lethargy/Dysarthria/Hypotension: Suspect general 
trend of patient's symptoms over past months to weeks represents 
a progression of her PD (see below) with dysautonomia. Suspect 
symptoms yesterday AM could all be consistent with PD, though 
difficult to explain acute worsening/improvement. Could be 
medication related (patient uncertain if she ___ have missed a 
few meds that AM). Could represent underlying infection 
exacerbating PD symptoms, though infectious work up during this 
hospitalization was negative and patient had no localizing 
symptoms. Acute confusion/dysarthria concerning also for 
TIA/Stroke/Siezure, but event was witnessed, and no focal 
neurological deficits other than dysarthria was reported and no 
seizure like-activity was noted. Did not report CP, but ACS 
could cause hypotension (though presumably with other symptoms 
of heart failure); ACS rule out was negative. This diffuse 
weakness/fatigue could also represent another systemic process 
altogether (though this is highly unlikely in the setting of a 
pre-exisitng systemic disease which readily explains her 
symtpoms); hypothyroidism (TSH normal), adrenal insufficiency 
(AM cortisol normal), myopathy or myasthenia ___ (though 
acutally surprsingly strong on strenght testing). During 
hosptialization patient continued to endorse fatigue which she 
had been experiencing for past several weeks, but the symptoms 
which brought her into the hospital had resolved and did not 
recur. 
 
# ___: Diagnosed ___ yrs ago. Presented with gait ataxia 
and tremor, current decline has been complicated with 
dysautonomia. Could also be consistent with Multiple Systems 
Atrophy (MSA). Symptoms that suggest MSA: urinary issues, 
dysautonomia, Raynaud's (which I suspect ___ be this transient 
"bruising" of her hands she has been describing). Outpatient 
neurologist seems to also have suspicion for MSA (suggesting 
outpatient DATscan to add in differentiating the two). Overall, 
patient's current presentation seems most consistent with a 
gradual decline in her PD (or possibly MSA), worsened over past 
several months. Given this, patient would probably benefit most 
from close follow up with existing neurologist for evaluation of 
MSA vs PD as well as adjustment of medications. For this reason, 
inpatient neurology consult was deferred. Patient was was also 
evaluated by ___ who cleared patient for home ___ with current 
high level of services. Continued home amantidine, 
Carbidopa-Levodopa, Tasmar and rasagiline. Left message with Dr 
___ at ___ (outpatient neurologist) requesting an earlier 
appointment date for patient (currently scheduled for ___, 
unable to schedule any sooner or reach the doctor).   

CHRONIC ISSUES: 
===========
# Urinary Retention: normally doesn't straight cath. presumably 
___ PD. Follows with outside urologist. Suspect urinary 
retention in ED was from missing AM bladder meds. No further 
issues during this hosptialization. Continued home bethanechol 
and tamsulosin. Of note, tamsulosin ___ contribute to episodes 
of hypotension; would recommend reevaluation with outpatient 
urologist. Continued home nitrofurantoin for prophylaxis of 
chronic UTIs in setting of urinary retention.

# h/o isolated seizure: unclear etiology, unknown work up 
(preformed at OSH). Continued home keppra. 

# OA: continued home celebrex.
 
# Seasonal Allergies: continued home loratadine and fluticasone 
nasal spray. 

# Anxiety: continued home clonazepam. Held home venlafaxine and 
sertraline given risk of seratonin syndrome with rasagiline. 
  
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
====================
- blood pressure surveillance by ___ advised
- to follow up with neurologist for further management of 
___ (versus Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA)) and 
associated dysautonomia, ataxia
- consider d/c'ing tamsulosin as outpatient in consultation with 
urologist, as could be contributing to issues of hypotension
- combination of rasagiline and venlafaxine puts patient at high 
risk of seratonin syndrome; would recommend discontinuation of 
venlafaxine for now, with re-assessment of these two medications 
by outpatient prescriber
- further medication reconciliation advised in the outpatient 
setting, given difficulty reconciling medications with absolute 
certainty following discussion with patient and call to pharmacy
- CODE: FULL
