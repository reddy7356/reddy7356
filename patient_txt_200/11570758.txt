Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  ___ with h/o of BPH and recent prostate 
biopsy who presented with fever, UTI, urinary retention and 
severe diarrhea found to have leukocytosis and acute bacterial 
prostatitis.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# Leukocytosis: Initial presented with diarrhea and profound 
leukomoid reaction was concerning for C.diff related diarrhea. 
Stool assay was however negative. UTI was also considered a 
possibility however culture was negative. Ultimately given 
recent biopsy and associated pyuria, dyschezia and bladder 
spasms, leukocytosis seemed most consistent with acute bacterial 
prostatitis. Patient was tapered to ciprofloxacin. He will need 
to continue this medication until ___. CT scan did not show any 
evidence of prostatic abscess so surgical intervention was not 
entertained. 

# Urinary retention: Patient with history of BPH. On previous 
presentation to ED, patient presented with acute retention. This 
was after recent prostate biopsy. Per patient he had similar 
episode after herniorrhaphy. Voiding trial was attempted however 
patient failed and urinary catheter was replaced. Patient was 
discharged with catheter and close urology follow up. Of note 
patient was neurologically intact and thus there was little 
concern for sacral nerve damage.  Patient was continued on 
finasteride and flomax.

# Diarrhea: Patient presented with acute onset of multiple bowel 
movements. In the setting of profound leukocytosis, there was 
concern for C.diff related diarrhea however assay was negative. 
Stool culture was also negative for other enteric pathogens. 
After investigating this further, it appeared that patient was 
having increased urgency, dyschezia and tennesmus from local 
inflammation from prostate. Patient was started on ibuprofen and 
was given one dose of loperamide which controlled symptoms. 
Patient was advised that cipro may cause diarrhea and if it 
recurs, to contact medical providers.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ] Several blood cultures are pending at discharge. This will 
be followed up by discharging team. However, providers can also 
call ___, if results are needed.
[ ] Patient will have follow up with urology for voiding trial

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you had diarrhea and 
pain with defecation. We believe you have an infection of your 
prostate. You will be on antibiotics until We attempted to have 
the bladder catheter removed however you were unable to void on 
your own. As a result the catheter had to go in and you will 
need to follow up with urology on ___. The catheter will have 
to remain in until that time. You also complained of diarrhea. 
We checked it for C.diff and other infections and the results 
were negative. We believe this may have been related to the 
antibiotics you took and perhaps because of inflammation in the 
pelvic area.
 
Followup Instructions:
