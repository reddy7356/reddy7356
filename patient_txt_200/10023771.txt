The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent CABG X 4.  
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was 
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  Immediately 
post-operatively, the patient had significant sanginous chest 
tube output. Multiple products were given including PRBCs, Plts, 
FFP, and Cryo. Protamine was also given for ACT in the 130's. 
The patient's Hct decreased to 19. SBPs were high, and a Nitro 
gtt was required for maintain normal BPs. CXR did not show 
evidence of tamponade. The patient remained intubated overnight 
with high PEEPs in attempts to decrease bleeding. Ultimately, 
the output became less and serous in nature. Hct after 
transfusions was 25. On POD 1, the patient was extubated. He was 
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was 
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic 
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the 
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The 
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further 
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued 
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical 
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility. On 
POD 3, Plavix was started (the patient was on Plavix before the 
operation, however there is no history of stent placement). 
Additionally, the patient had short bursts of A-Fib seen on 
telemetry. SBP was stable and the patient was asymptomatic. His 
beta-blocker was increased and Amiodarone was started orally.  
By the time of discharge on POD 5 the patient was ambulating 
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral 
analgesics.  He is in normal sinus rhythm. The patient was 
discharged to ___ in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.
