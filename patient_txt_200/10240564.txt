Radiology ReportCT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRASTStudy Date of ___ 
3:40 ___
PRELIMINARY REPORT
Large subcutaneous hematoma extending from the left groin access 
site
inferiorly to the superior medial thigh, and superiorly to the 
left iliac
crest. No retroperitoneal blood

Radiology ReportFEMORAL VASCULAR US LEFTStudy Date of ___ 
9:06 AM
No pseudoaneurysm identified in the left groin. A limited
examination was performed due to the large infiltrative hematoma 
in the left
groin. No discrete collection identified.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ year old male with history of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, CAD, diabetes, who presented for elective 
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of right 
superficial femoral artery, complicated by large hematoma 
requiring ICU monitoring. 

# Left Groin Hematoma: 
Patient was transfused two units of pRBCs, after which his 
hematocrit remained stable.  His coumadin was held in the 
setting of bleed, but his aspirin and plavix were continued in 
the setting of recent stenting. Left groin ultrasound ruled out 
aneurysm and AV fistula, and noncontrast CT scan ruled out 
retroperitoneal bleed. CT scan showed extent of large hematoma 
in subcutaneous tissue.  

# Peripheral Vascular Disease: 
Right Superficial Femoral Artery was successfully stented by 
Interventional Cardiology. The patient was noted to have 
complication of large left hematoma at the site of entry for the 
procedure.  After the procedure, the patient's right foot was 
noted to have strong dorsalis pedis pulse and was warm, well 
perfused, while the left foot felt colder in comparison with 
dopplerable pulses.
.  
# Hypertension:
Home dose of metoprolol was held overnight in order to monitor 
hemodynamic status more effectively and in setting of 
bradycardia with ventricular rates in ___ metoprolol was 
restarted prior to discharge.  Patient may benefit from an ACE 
inhibitor for renal and cardiac protection in the setting of 
diabetes and heart disease if there are no contraindications to 
its use in him. 
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: 
Lipid panel was last checked in the ___ system in ___, and 
lipids appear to have been well controlled at that time.  
Patient was continued on home dose atorvastatin during this 
hospitalization. 
.  
# Coronary Artery Disease:
Patient was continued on aspiring, plavix, statin.  His 
metoprolol was held overnight to monitor his hemodynamic status 
and was restarted prior to discharge.
.  
 
# Chronic renal insufficiency: 
Patient presumed to have chronic renal insufficiency because 
creatinine in ___ in ___ system was 1.2, though patient may 
have had acute issue at that time elevating creatinine; current 
baseline renal function unclear. Creatinine 1.4 prior to 
angiography, stable at 1.3 prior to discharge.  Creatinine 
should be closely monitored after contrast load for procedure in 
the setting of renal insufficiency.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus:
Patient's metformin was held during hospitalization and is to be 
restarted the day after discharge.  His blood sugars were 
monitored, and he was placed on an insulin sliding scale during 
this hospitalization. 
.  
# Atrail Fibrillation: 
Patient is on coumadin at home, which was held overnight in the 
setting of bleed and restarted the next day when hematoma was 
found to be stable.  Patient remained in slow atrial 
fibrillation, rates in ___ during this hospitalization, likely 
with some vagal response from groin hematoma.  Metoprolol was 
held in the setting of already slow rate. 
 
.  
# COPD:
Home Advair was continued.
.
# Gout: 
Patient was continued on home dose allopurinol.

be contacted by Dr. ___ on ___. If you do not hear from 
 him by noon on ___ please call him at ___. Please

The following changes have been made to your medications: 
- Stop coumadin until your appointment with Dr. ___ on 
___
- START plavix 75mg by mouth daily - please do not stop taking 
this for any reason. Only your cardiologist should stop this
