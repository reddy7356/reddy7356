L Spine xray:
FINDINGS: There is a rather dramatic levoconcave curvature of 
the included
lower thoracic and lumbar spine. No secondary endplate changes 
are noted,
raising the suspicion this is likely simply positional in 
nature. Vertebral
bodies are intact. Disc spaces are maintained. Aside from 
curvature,
alignment otherwise is anatomic. The neural foramina are widely 
patent.
Transitional segmentation is noted at the lumbosacral junction. 
The
paraspinal soft tissues are unremarkable.
 
IMPRESSION: No traumatic injury or significant underlying 
degenerative joint
disease.

MRI L spine:
FINDINGS: From T11-12 to L2-3 no abnormalities are seen. At L3-4 
mild disc
bulging identified. No spinal stenosis or foraminal narrowing is 
identified.
 
At L4-5 there has been a previous hemilaminectomy. There is no 
evidence of
recurrent disc herniation seen.
 
At L5-S1 level degenerative disc disease and mild bulging seen 
without spinal
stenosis. An annular tear is seen on the right side. There is no 
evidence of
nerve root compression seen.
 
There is no evidence of epidural abscess or fluid collection 
identified in the
paraspinal region. A subtle area of artifact seen to the left of 
midline at
L4-5 level projected over the posterior aspect of the thecal sac 
appears
artifacts probably related to previous surgery.
 
IMPRESSION: Mild degenerative changes. No evidence of recurrent 
disc
herniation. No evidence of epidural abscess.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms ___ was admitted to the medical service with low back pain 
and lower extremity weakness L>R as well as total body 
parasthesias.  On exam she had no evidence for cord compression, 
no sensory or motor deficits. She was seen by both the neurology 
and neurosurgical/spine teams.  She underwent an MRI of her L 
spine which did not reveal any cord or nerve root compression. 
She did not demonstrate any functional neurologic deficits on 
formal exam. Her laboratory work up revealed normal CBC and 
electrolytes, normal CK, normal renal function, normal UA, 
negative SPEP (UPEP still pending at this time), normal B12, 
high TSH but with normal free T4, negative RPR.  She was seen by 
physical therapy and was able to ambulate independently. She was 
discharged home day after admission with outpatient follow up.

___ sessions a week x 10 weeks.  

 
Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:

Discharge Condition:
Good. Vital signs stable, ambulating independently

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with back pain and lower extremity weakness. 
You had an MRI of your lumbar spine which did not show any 
spinal cord or nerve root compression. You were seen by the 
neurology and spine teams who did not find an anatomical 
etiology for your symptoms.  Your B12 levels were normal.  Your 
thyroid levels were bordlerline, you should follow up with your 
PCP to have these rechecked, as well as to follow up on the 
results of some other blood work, notably protein 
electrophoresis.  Your neurontin was discontinued as their have 
been some reports of this medication causing the symptoms you 
experienced. You have been given a prescription for valium, a 
muscle relaxant, to be taken as needed for back spasm. This 
medication can cause drowsiness, to not take before driving. 
Please take all medications as prescribed. Please follow up with 
your primary care provider ___ 2 weeks.  
Call your doctor or return to the emergency room if you 
experience worsening pain, weakness, bowel incontinence or 
urinary retenion. 
 
Followup Instructions:
