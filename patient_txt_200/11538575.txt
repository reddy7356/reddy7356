Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and 
was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. 
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following:

1. Fever 101.2, overnight POD#1->#2, hx/o splenectomy, flu swab 
negative, malaria peripheral smear, Hep B titer + fever w/u 
initiated (cxr, u/a, blood & urine cxs).  Infectious disease was 
consulted and she was empirically started on vancomycin and 
ceftriaxone on POD#2.  Vancomycin was d/c'd on POD#5 and 
ceftriaxone was d/c'd on POD#7 per ID recommendations.  All 
cultures and tests negative. 

2. HTN/Tachycardia, overnight POD#1->#2->medicine consulted, EKG 
showing sinus tach, unlikely PE as O2 sats in high 90's on RA, 
likely post op blood loss anemia, trended Hct.  Received 2 units 
PRBC's on POD#4 and tachycardia resolved for remainder of 
hospital course.

3. ___ swelling- an US was done and negative for DVT.

Otherwise, pain was initially controlled with a PCA followed by 
a transition to oral pain medications on POD#1.  The patient 
received lovenox for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of 
POD#1.  The foley was removed on POD#2 and the patient was 
voiding independently thereafter. The overlying surgical 
dressing was changed on POD#2 and the Silverlon dressing was 
found to be clean and intact without erythema or abnormal 
drainage. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs 
were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted 
accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating 
a regular diet and feeling well.  The patient was afebrile with 
stable vital signs.  The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and 
pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative 
extremity was neurovascularly intact and the wound was benign. 

The patient's weight-bearing status is weight bearing as 
tolerated on the operative extremity.

Active Problems
1) Subdural Hematoma: Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ on ___ 
after MVA with positive head strike.  cleared by ACS in the

neurosurgical service for observation. She was started on Keppra 
for seizure prophylaxis, and BP control (goal SBP <16) with 
atenolol and prn hydralazine. She remained neurologically stable 
with only complaint of back pain, but CT torso was normal. A 
repeat Head CT was performed on ___ and ___ were stable and 
revealed some resolution of the previously seen SDH.  She will 
reamin on keppra until f/u with neurosurgery on ___, at 
which time she will also have followup CT. 

2) Thrombocytopenia: It was noted that her platelet count was 
only 30k. This was repeated and confirmed 30k. Hematology was 
called for recommendations. She was transfused 3 units of 
platelets. Completed a 4-day course of dexamethasone 40mg, and 
receivd 1 infusion of IVIG. She responded well to the treatment, 
platelets trended up to 129 on day of discharge.  

3) Positive guaiac: Hct stable in at ___. However, 
thrombocytopenia may unmask colonic growths, although it is 
unlikely with normal colonoscopy 1 months prior to admission. 

Inactive Problems:
1) Subconjunctival Hemorrhage: Ophthomology was consulted who 
felt that the findings were c/w minor trauma in the setting of 
thrombocytopenia, not concerning for retinal or CN involvement. 

Transfer of Care:

headache, gait abnormality, confusion, or any other neurological 
symptoms may indicate expansion of SDH. Pt will need emergent CT 
and evulation.
2) Thrombocytopenia-please f/u platelet counts to monotiro 
improvement. If pt continues to be severely thrombocytopenic, 
she may need BM biopsy for evaluation and/or splenectomy 
depending on BM results. 
3) Positive guaiac-malignancy may be unmasked by 
thrombocytopenia. Pt has followup appointment with PCP at ___. 
Per patient, she had a normal colonoscopy with removal of benign 
polyp 1 month ago and has f/u colonoscopy in ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___

___ was a pleasure taking care of you. You were admitted after a 
motor vehicle accident, and was found to have a small subdural 
hematoma, which means you had a bleeding in your brain that had 
stopped. You were initially admitted to the neurosurgery 
service, who decided to treat you conservatively, without 
surgery. Your neurological exam and CT scans had been stable 
during your stay. Due to your head injury, you are at an 
increased risk of seizures. You were started on an anti-seizure 
medication (Keppra) and will stay on this medication for 4 
weeks. We also recommend that you avoid lifting heavy objects, 
taking any drugs that will thin your blood (such as aspirin), 
and use stool softner for the next month. If you do develop an 
change in your mental status, new or worsening headaches, vision 
problems, or gait problem, please report to a physician 
___. 

During this admission, it was incidentally found that you had a 
low platelet count, which may be due to a condition called 
Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), a condition caused by 
increased destruction of platelets due to unknown cause. Your 
HIV test was negative. You were treated with steriods for 4 days 
and one infusion of IVIG. We also transfused you with 3units of 
platelets. You platelet counts returned to normal on ___. You 
will need to check your platelets at the followup visit.

The medications you will go home with are:
1. Keppra (Levetiracetam)500 mg every 12 hours: This is the 
anti-seizure medication. You will stay on this medication for 4 
weeks. You will followup with the neurosurgeon attending who 
took care of you, Dr. ___.
2. Atenolol 25 mg everyday: This is a medicaiton for your blood 
pressure. We ideally want to keep your systolic blood pressure 
under 160 to prevent possible extension of the bleed inside your 
head.
3. Docusate Sodium 100mg and Senna 8.6mg everyday: these 
medications will help soften your stool to prevent straining 
when you go to the bathroom.
4. Oxycodone 5mg and acetaminophen 325mg daily: these 
medications will help manage your pain

Here are additional recommendations from neurosurgery:
1. Take your pain medicine as prescribed
2. Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining, 
or excessive bending.
3. Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain 
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking 
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace) 
while taking narcotic pain medication.
4. Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any 
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, or 
Ibuprofen etc. 
5. If a physican recomends for you to begin a medication such as 
Coumadin (Warfarin), or Plavix (clopidogrel), or Aspirin 
following to your injury, do not begin these until cleared by 
Neurosurgery Dr ___.
6. You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam)500 mg 
every 12 hours, you will not require blood work monitoring.
