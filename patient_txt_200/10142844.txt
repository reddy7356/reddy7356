History of Present Illness:
  ___ with history of cluster headaches, anxiety, EtOH use 
disorder, depression and syncopal episode in ___ who was 
brought to ___ ED by EMS after a witnessed syncopal episode 
with headstrike, with progressive AMS and hypoxia requiring 
intubation in the ED, admitted to ICU for syncope and hypoxia 
workup.

On the day prior to admission ___ he was sitting on a bench and 
was witnessed by friends to fall, landing on his face, without 
appreciable seizure-like activities or shaking afterwards. This 
was in the setting of drinking 5 beers.  He was somewhat 
confused after the event and there is a report of 5 minute LOC 
and ENS bag-mask ventilation. He was afebrile, tachycardic to 
120, BP 160/96 in the field with FSG 135. He was transferred to 
___ ED. 

In ED initial VS: 97.1 | 120 | 134/88 | 18 | 95% RA  
He was alert and oriented x3 but was perseverating. he denied 
any chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, cough, 
fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. Denies any other illness 
prior to this episode. No history of seizures though has had 
syncope in ___ with facial fracture, and has had head trauma 
d/t falls and assault in the past. 

Exam:  His exam was notable to A&Ox4, NAD but pale and 
diaphoretic. Abrasions were noted over right supraorbital 
region. No other signs of external trauma. He was moving all 
extremities. 

Given initial normal labs and imaging, including CTA chest and 
CXR, he was enrolled into the syncope pathway and was to be in 
ED-obs overnight for echocardiogram in AM to complete syncope 
workup.  

In the ED he was noted to have some transient episodes of 
hypoxia to 80-85% on RA which initially improved with ___ NC. 
At 0230, he was noted to have progressive worsening hypoxia, 
"then sudden change in mental status and apnea requiring 
intubation," with fent/versed for sedation. At the time he 
seemed to have some right gaze deviation, LLE twitching and 
right hand clenching.

STUDIES
=======
___ CXR IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process. 
  
___ CTA CHEST IMPRESSION:  
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic 
abnormality. 
2. Mild bronchial wall thickening suggestive of airway 
inflammation. 

___ CT HEAD w/o CONTRAST IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial 
process. 

___ ECHOCARDIOGRAM Conclusions: The left atrium is normal in 
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical 
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully 
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 
= 75%). The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. 
Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal 
free wall function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the 
sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The number of 
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior 
motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 
  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the left ventricle is now hyperdynamic with mitral valvular (and 
chordal) systolic anterior motion but no manifest resting left 
ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
 
You were brought to the ___ after a fall 
and you had an episode that was though to be a seizure in the 
ED. You needed a breathing tube and were admitted to the 
Intensive Care Unit for monitoring after this episode. You were 
given a very long lasting medication to protect yourself against 
features (phenobarbital).
Fortunately, you were able to come off the breathing machine and 
had no further episodes. 
Unfortunately, you chose to left the hospital against medical 
advice. 
 
You understood the risks of leaving and especially of drinking 
alcohol while the medication (phenobarbital) is active in your 
body which include:
- Death from not breathing
- Low blood pressure
- Coma
 
We urge you NOT TO DRINK ALCOHOL as this may be life threatening 
while the medication (phenobarbital) is in your system

We urge you to MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR PRIMARY CARE 
DOCTOR.

___ do not take BUPROPION (WELLBUTRIN) or FIORICET or 
CLONAZEPAM as these have interactions with the phenobarbital 
that stays in your system for days. 

Please talk your doctor about restarting these medications

We wish you the best in health,

Your ___ Team

MICROBIOLOGY:  NONE

IMAGING:
CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS ___:
FINDINGS:  Linear opacity at the lung bases most likely 
represents atelectasis or scarring.  A nodule in the right lung 
base measures 2 mm.  There is no pleural or pericardial 
effusion. Diffuse hypodensity of the liver parenchyma indicates 
hepatic steatosis. There are no focal liver lesions.  The 
gallbladder appears normal.  Fat stranding adjacent to the tail 
of the pancreas may represent focal pancreatitis.  The left 
renal fascia is thickening and there is adjacent fat stranding.  
The spleen and adrenal glands appear normal.  The kidneys 
enhance symmetrically
and promptly excrete contrast.  No renal stones or concerning 
renal lesions are identified. The bladder is partially filled 
and appears normal.  The prostate is unremarkable. The stomach 
is decompressed.  The small bowel appears normal without 
evidence of wall thickening or obstruction.  There is colonic 
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  The appendix 
is visualized in the right lower quadrant and appears normal.  
There is no free fluid, free air or pathologic lymphadenopathy 
by CT size criteria.  There are calcifications within a normal
caliber aorta. 
OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No concerning osteoblastic or osteolytic 
lesions identified.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fat stranding adjacent to the tail of the pancreas and 
thickening of the left pararenal fascia is most consistent with 
acute pancreatitis.  There is no decreased pancreatic 
parenchymal enhancement, peripancreatic free fluid or fluid 
collections.  No biliary dilation or gallstones identified.
2.  The kidneys appear normal without evidence of stones, 
hydronephrosis or masses.
3.  Hepatic steatosis.
4.  Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulosis.
5.  A nodule in the right lung base measures 2 mm. Follow-up CT 
in ___ year is recommended if the patient has risk factors for 
lung cancer or known prior malignancy.

RUQ U/S ___:
FINDINGS:  The liver is mildly echogenic, consistent with fatty 
deposition.  No focal lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal 
dilatation is seen.  The common bile duct is normal measuring 
0.4 cm.  The pancreas is not assessed on this exam.  The 
gallbladder is normal without evidence of cholelithiasis or 
cholecystitis.  Doppler assessment of the main portal vein 
demonstrates normal hepatopetal flow.  There is no evidence of 
ascites. Limited assessment of the right kidney is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis.
2.  Echogenic liver is consistent with fatty deposition.  More 
advanced forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or hepatic 
fibrosis cannot be excluded by this study, however.

CXR ___:
FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are low.  There is persistent mild 
relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the 
left side.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear 
stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  New 
streaky opacities involve each lung base as well as the left mid 
lung, the latter probably associated with the lingula.  This 
appearance is very suggestive of minor atelectasis.  Elsewhere, 
the lungs appear clear.
IMPRESSION:  New basilar opacities, most likely due to 
atelectasis.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH of migraine, depression and history of alcoholism 
is admitted with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and CT 
findings strongly suggestive of pancreatitis.  

# Abdominal pain: Patient presented with 2 days of N/V/abdominal 
pain. CT findings suggestive of pancreatitis with lipase of 61. 
RUQ u/s and CT do not suggest cholestatic source, and ALP was 
normal.  Leukocytosis on admission was probably reactive to 
pancreatitis, resolved.  No fever during admission.  Abdominal 
exam benign.  Patient felt better by the morning after 
admission, without emesis for almost 48 hours and with improved 
appetite, able to tolerate solid foods.  Provided IV morphine 
and then PO oxycodone for pain control.  Used IV ativan for 
nausea control given QTc prolongation.

# Sinus tachycardia: Initially was in sinus tachycardia 100-120s 
on admission.  No known history of tachycardia.  ___ be 
associated with dehydration and pain, no other clear sympathetic 
drivers.  Resolved with IVF.

# Long QT:  No obvious QT prolonging medications.  Avoided 
Zofran, compazine given this EKG finding.  No evidence of 
arrhythmia on telemetry.
# Hip pain: Likely MSK given resolution with passive ROM.  
Resolved by discharge.
# Depression: continued Wellbutrin
# Migraine: held home Fioricet
 
# Code: full - confirmed with pt  
# Emergency Contact: ___ (friend) ___  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- CT abdomen:  there was a 2 mm right lower lobe nodule.  
Follow-up CT in ___ year is recommended if the patient has risk 
factors for lung cancer. No follow-up is recommended if the 
patient does not have any risk factors.

 
Medications on Admission:
The Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.
1. Acetaminophen-Caff-Butalbital 1 TAB PO BID:PRN migraine 
2. Wellbutrin XL (buPROPion HCl) 300 mg oral daily 

 
Discharge Medications:
1. Acetaminophen-Caff-Butalbital 1 TAB PO BID:PRN migraine 
2. Wellbutrin XL (buPROPion HCl) 300 mg oral daily 
3. Lorazepam 0.5 mg PO Q4H:PRN nausea 
___ cause sedation.  Do not drive while using.

CARDIOLOGY:
EKG ___: Sinus rhythm. Right ventricular conduction delay. 
Downsloping ST segment elevation in lead V2. Compared to the 
previous tracing of ___ repolarization abnormality in lead 
V2 is now present. This finding is highly concerning for Brugada 
syndrome as the potential etiology of syncope. 

EKG ___ rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing 
Brugada pattern repolarization abnormalities is again noted in 
lead V2. 

ECHO ___:
Conclusions  
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. There is mild (non-obstructive) focal 
hypertrophy of the basal septum. The left ventricular cavity 
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. 
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with 
Valsalva. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally 
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral 
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old man with a family history of 
SCD 
was referred to the lab for arrhythmia evaluation of a Brugada 
like EKG 
in the ER following a negative flecainide challenge. The patient 

exercise for 9 minutes of ___ protocol and stopped for 
fatigue. The 
estimated peak MET capacity was 10.1 which represents an average 

functional capacity for his age. No arm, neck, back or chest 
discomfort 
throughout. At peak exercise, there was 2 mm STE in V2 only with 
no 
other ST segment changes in any other lead throughout the study. 
The 
rhythm was sinus with no ectopy. Appropriate hemodynamic 
response to 
exercise and recovery. 
IMPRESSION: Non-specific ST changes in V2 only in the absence of 

symptoms or ectopy. 
 
EKG ___: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing the 
Brugada pattern of repolarization in lead V2 is less prominent. 

RADIOLOGY

CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLA ___
IMPRESSION: 
Nasal bone fractures, which may be acute.  Fractures through the 
frontal 
processes of the maxilla on the left and on the right. 

CXR ___: 
IMPRESSION: 
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

CT HEAD W/ AND W/O CONTRAST ___:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo male with history significant for family members with 
sudden cardiac death presents after a syncopal episodes with EKG 
findings concerning for Brugada syndrome vs. Orthostasis.  

# Syncope: Initial presentation was concerning for a malignant 
arrythmia inlight of family history and findings on EKG 
concerning for brugada syndrome. Family history more consistent 
with CAD rather than Brugada, but sister's sudden death is 
questionable. The significance of an normal EKG in ___ is 
unclear. Troponins were negative, ECHO was unremarkable, Stress 
test did not illustrate any coronary pathology, and overnight 
telemetry was with in normal limits. A flecainide study was 
conducted and failed to induce an arrhytmia. Repeat EKG was 
unremarkable. No history or findings to suggest seizure. History 
of orthostasis coupled with alcohol consumption likely resulted 
in syncopal event. 

# Nasal fracture: there was no evidence of septal hematoma. CT 
of sinuses/mandible/maxilla illustrated fractures of the frontal 
processes of the maxilla. Pain was controlled with oxycodone. 
Patient is scheduled with outpatient plastic surgery for nasal 
bridge repair.    

# Depression- Citalopram was held during hospitalization. 
Patient to resume home citalopram on discharge.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
[ ]Patient needs to be counseled on drinking behavior
[ ]Will need to follow up with plastic surgery for nasal bone 
fracture.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your hospitalization 
at ___. You were admitted after losing consciousness. An EKG 
was performed in the emergency room which was concerning for an 
abnormal rhythm. We performed several studies which were not 
consistent with this abnormal EKG, and a repeat EKG was normal.  
You are scheduled to see a cardiologist in a few weeks to make 
sure you continue to do well.

In addition, after falling, you broke your nose. You have an 
appointment to see the plastic surgeons regarding this fracture.

We made the following changes to your medication list:
Please START taking oxycodone 5mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed 
for pain.
Please CONTINUE taking the rest of your medications as 
prescribed.
