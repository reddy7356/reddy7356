CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  ___ 5:02 AM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABD W&W/O C

Reason: EVAL FOR PE/STONE
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
___ year old man with left chest pain, worse with inspiration 
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pe 
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Left chest pain. Evaluate for pulmonary embolism or 
renal stone.

TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast MDCT through the abdomen and pelvis 
followed by Contrast-enhanced MDCT of the chest, abdomen and 
pelvis. Multiplanar reformations were provided.

COMPARISON: None.

CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There is a saddle embolus at the 
bifurcation of the right middle and right lower lobe pulmonary 
artery with extension of clot distally into the segmental and 
subsegmental branches. There may be left sided pulmonary embolus 
in the left lower lobe superior segmental branch, seen only on a 
single image (S3a:I22). The heart and great vessels of the 
mediastinum are otherwise unremarkable. There is residual thymic 
tissue. There is no pathologic adenopathy. The lungs are clear 
asiode from minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. There is 
no left pleural effusion. A tiny right pleural effusion is 
noted. The airways are patent to the subsegmental level. 
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, 
spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are 
normal. There is no free air, free fluid or pathologic 
adenopathy. Multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes do not meet 
pathologic criteria.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid, large bowel, 
prostate, seminal vesicles, bladder and pelvic small bowel loops 
are normal. There is no free air, free fluid or pathologic 
adenopathy. 

BONE WINDOWS: The osseous structures are normal. Note is made of 
a bone island in the left acetabular roof.

IMPRESSION: 

1. Right interlobar (saddle) PE extending into right middle and 
lower ___ branches. Probable small left lower lobe segmental 
PE. Tiny right pleural effusion, minimal right basilar 
atelectasis.

2. No acute intra-abdominal process.

___ bilateral ___ venous doppler U/S
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower 
extremities.

CHEST TWO VIEWS ___

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Alcohol withdrawal, fever, question 
pneumonia.

No prior chest x-rays for comparison.

At the right lung base, there is focal consolidation. There is 
also a focal opacity within the right middle lobe. These 
findings would be consistent with either pneumonia or 
aspiration. There is also a small right pleural effusion. The 
left lung is relatively clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
unremarkable. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Focal infiltrate/consolidation and right middle lobe and 
lower lobe consistent with aspiration versus pneumonia.
2. Small right pleural effusion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
This ___ yo male with no significant PMHx was admitted for right 
sided saddle PE.

1.  PE:  the patient was placed on heparin gtt after receiving a 
bolus and subsequently started on coumadin therapy.  His 
pleuritic chest pain was managed initially with IV dilaudid, 
then transitioned to oral analgesics.  The patient was deemed a 
poor candidate for lovenox bridge while on coumadin because of 
difficulty understanding the seriousness of his diagnosis.  A 
hypercoaguable work up for the etiology for his PE was 
initiated, given no instigating event or family history.  The 
patient had a negative testicular exam and no evidence of any 
LAD on a pelvic CT scan performed on admission.  His labs 
(factor V leiden, prothrombin mutation) were pending on 
discharge.  His INR was 2.0 on ___ and 2.3 on ___.  A nursing 
appointment was arranged at ___ for INR on ___.
