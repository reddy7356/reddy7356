History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male who presented to outside 
hospital in late ___ with chest discomfort following vigorous 
exercise. His chest discomfort was associated with nausea,

cardiac catheterization which revealed severe single vessel 
coronary artery disease which was not amenable to percutaneous 
intervention. Since that time, he has remained pain free on 
medical therapy. He presents today to discuss surgical 
revascularization.

Findings  
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. 

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. 
Normal regional LV systolic function. Overall normal LVEF 
(>55%). 

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta 
diameter. Focal calcifications in descending aorta. 

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace 
AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) 
MR. 

___ VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial 
TR. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the 
___. The ___ was under general anesthesia throughout the 
procedure. No TEE related complications.  

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:  

 
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic  
Conclusions  
PREBYPASS 
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is 
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left 
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular 
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. 

POSTBYPASS
There is preserved biventricular systolic function. MR remains 
mild. The study is otherwise unchanged from prebypass   
   I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance 
with ___ regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The ___ was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where he underwent CABGx3 (LIMA-LAD, 
SVG-Diag1/Diag2), please see OR note for further details.  
Overall the ___ tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  POD 1 found the 
___ extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
 The ___ was neurologically intact and hemodynamically 
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  The ___ was 
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Beta 
blocker was initiated and the ___ was gently diuresed toward 
the preoperative weight. Chest tubes remined in due to peristent 
airleak and left pneumothorax they were eventually discontinued 
on POD#3. Pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  
The ___ was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD 4, the ___ was ambulating freely, the wound was 
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The 
___ was discharged to home with ___ services in good 
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
