# RUQ u/s (___):
1. Abnormal biliary ductal dilation of uncertain etiology. This
may be due to distal obstructive lesion. 
2. Gallbladder sludge, gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, 
and gallbladder distention. Tenderness over the gallbladder. 
These findings may reflect acute cholecystitis. 
3. Splenomegaly 

# Central Line CXR (___): FINDINGS:  Right internal jugular 
central venous catheter ends at the mid SVC. Moderately enlarged 
cardiac silhouette.  There is calcification of the aortic knob 
with tortuosity of the descending thoracic aorta.  There is mild 
interstitial edema.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions.  No 
pneumothorax is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Right internal jugular 
central venous catheter ends at the mid SVC.  No 
pneumothorax is seen. 2. Mild interstitial edema with trace 
bilateral effusions. 

# Cholangiogram ___:  FINDINGS: 1. Transabdominal ultrasound of 
the liver and gallbladder demonstrates no intrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilatation.  Evaluation of the gallbladder demonstrates a 
markedly thickened gallbladder wall, minimal pericholecystic 
fluid and significant stones, sludge and debris within the 
gallbladder. 2. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram via 
access to the right posterior biliary system demonstrates a 
patent common bile duct and spontaneous flow of contrast through 
the ampulla into the small bowel.  Mild ampullary stenosis is 
noted.  Additionally, cholangiogram demonstrates a patent cystic 
duct. No stones are identified within the common bile duct or 
intrahepatic bile ducts.  CBD filling defects are attributed to 
air bubbles. 3. Appropriately placed 10 ___, percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary catheter via access within the right 
anterior bile ducts. 4. Appropriately placed 8 ___, 
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube terminating within the 
gallbladder. 
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of significant intrahepatic biliary 
ductal dilatation however the common bile duct shows mild to 
moderate dilatation and there is evidence of at least mild 
ampullary stenosis. No stones are identified within the common 
bile duct or intrahepatic bile ducts. 
2. Markedly dilated, thick walled gallbladder containing stones
and sludge.  Minimal pericholecystic fluid. These ultrasound 
findings are consistent with cholecystitis however fluoroscopic 
findings demonstrate a patent cystic duct.  This constellation 
of findings suggests chronic cholecystitis. 3. Appropriately 
placed 10 ___ percutaneous transhepatic biliary catheter via 
the right-sided biliary ducts and appropriately placed 8 ___ 
percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter. Both catheters are 
attached to bag.  

# Cholangiogram, PTBD Exchange (___): FINDINGS: 1. 
Appropriately positioned pre-existing 10 ___ right 
percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter.  
Appropriately positioned 8 ___ percutaneous cholecystostomy 
tube. 2. Cholangiogram showing distal CBD stricture, with 
associated severe common bile duct dilatation and reflux of 
contrast into the cystic duct and eventually the gallbladder.  
There is also associated moderate intrahepatic biliary 
dilatation. 3. Successful 10 mm balloon cholangioplasty of the 
distal CBD stricture, with minimal improvement in antegrade flow 
of contrast through the biliary system. 4. Successful exchange 
of the pre-existing 10 ___ right percutaneous transhepatic 
biliary drainage catheter with a new 12 ___ internal external 
right percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter.   
IMPRESSION:  1.  Technically successful 10 mm balloon cholangio 
plasty of the distal CBD stricture, with minimal improvement in 
antegrade flow. 2.  Successful exchange of existing percutaneous 
transhepatic biliary drainage catheter with a new right 12 
___ internal external percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
drainage catheter.  This drainage catheter was capped. 3.  The 
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was left to bag. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:

Mr. ___ is a pleasant ___ yo M with prior RNY gastric bypass who 
was admitted with abd pain with signs/symptoms most c/w 
cholecystitis with associated choledocholithiasis and 
cholangitis. He also presented with elevated lipase c/w possible 
pancreatitis. 

# Septic shock 
# Cholangitis
# Cholecystitis 
# EColi bacteremia  
Initially presented to ___ with RUQ pain, nausea, 
vomiting, with RUQ u/s demonstrating abnormal dilation of CBD 
with gall bladder wall thickening and distention c/f 
cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis with c/f cholangitis.  He 
was transferred here to the inpatient floor here at ___ for 
further mgmt.  His admit labs were notable for mild leukocytosis 
(WBC 10) and transaminitis: ALT 70 AST 76 AP 518 TBili 6.7 
Direct 6.0.  In addition, OSH Blood cultures had grew GNRs from 
BCx obtained ___. 
   However, he quickly developed hypotension on the floor (night 
of ___ and was transferred to the MICU. He was temporarily 
placed on Levophed and given extensive fluid resuscitation along 
with IV abx (zosyn).  Given the concern for cholangitis, ___ and 
ERCP teams were consulted.  Due to the hemodynamic instability 
and the likelihood that ERCP procedure would be complicated and 
prolonged (pt is s/p Roux-En-Y), the decision was to proceed 
directly for ___ procedures of 2 procedures: (1) perc chole drain 
for the cholecystitis, which returned of purulent fluid and (2) 
PTBD to drain bile from biliary tree through ampulla 
(hepatojejunal anastomosis).  The PTBD did not reveal any stones 
in biliary tree.  The drains were placed under temporary 
intubation - he was extubated after the procedure was done. 
Levophed was weaned off on ___ and he was continued on zosyn 
(___).  he was transferred to the inpatient floor on ___. 
    On the floor, he was treated with IV zosyn - and then 
transitioned to oral cipro/flagyl on ___ when it was evidently 
clear that he was clinically stable and the GNR growing from the 
blood cxs revealed pan-sensitive Ecoli.  The PTBD drain was 
clamped and the Perc chole tube was kept open to the bag.  He 
did well on this regimen - and underwent another cholangiogram 
and PTBD study on ___ to re-eval the CBD anatomy.  The study 
revealed, again, no stones, but a stricture at the 
biliary-intestinal anastomotic site.  This area was ballooned 
and a larger PTBD drain was put in place.  The LFTs have 
continued to steadily decrease during the course of this 
hospitalization (with final LFTs listed above).  
    Throughout the latter hospital stay, Mr. ___ had no 
abdominal pain; was able to tolerate regular diet; and good PO 
intake.  His vitals were stable and he did well with the oral 
antibiotics.
    He and Ms. ___ expressed desire to drive home and get 
follow up at ___ where their doctors ___.  ___ was 
arranged for their temporary stay in ___, however, due 
to a local tornado, that plan was changed and the Mr and Mrs 
___ plan on driving down to ___ through the next week.  
Drain care training was given and extra supplies given.  
Ultimately, Mr. ___ will need cholecystectomy.  He should 
follow with ___, surgery and his PCP.  Also prior to the surgery, 
cardiology eval was recommended for pre-op clearance. 
     

# Type 2 NSTEMI
# CAD e/o prior inferior infarct on EKG
# Peripheral edema 
Mr. ___ has history of 1v CAD - s/p LHC ___: clean LM/LAD, Cx, 
100% RCA occlusion with L->R collaterals from L Cx. Patient 
reported chest discomfort on arrival to ICU but this resolved 
with morphine. EKG without acute changes from OSH EKG but noted 
to have inferior q waves c/f old infarct. Currently chest pain 
free, troponin peaked to 0.30 on ___ and has downtrended since 
then. He was restarted on ASA and statin. 
  The suspicion for Type I NSTEMI was low. However, given the 
NSTEMI, he was informed that it would be best if he would follow 
up with his cardiologist - particularly pre-operatively - for 
concern for TTE and possibly stress test.  On transfer to the 
floor, Mr. ___ was clearly edematous with ___ PE up to 
knee/thigh bilaterally.  He was given IV Lasix 40mg daily - with 
brisk response.  On the floor, he had net 13L. His d/c weight 
was 233.8 lbs. 
  
# Pancreatitis 
Likely in setting of gallstone disease, lipase downtrended. His 
diet was advanced and he remained pain free.

#Hypoalbuin

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,
   
    It was a real pleasure looking after you.  As you know, you 
were admitted to our hospital for infection of your gallbladder 
and bile ducts.  You were found to be "septic" - which occurred 
as a result of disseminated infection with bacteria (E.Coli) 
transiently entering into your blood.  You were temporarily 
housed in our intensive care unit - to ensure you were getting 
aggressive care of your low blood pressure (which occurs as a 
result of the sepsis).

   To address the infection, you were given antibiotics and also 
underwent procedures called cholecystostomy (drain into gall 
bladder) and PTBD (drain through the liver, the bile duct and 
into the small intestines).  These drains are needed to help 
facilitate adequate flow of the biliary system and reduce the 
burden of infection.  The PTBD drain should be fully clamped 
(closed), while the cholecystostomy tube (the ony leading to the 
gallbladder) should be open and draining into the bag.  Please 
follow the instructions given to you regarding the drain care. 

   You should continue with your antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and 
flagyl) as instructed.  Furthermore, you should continue to take 
the Lasix - a diuretic to help rid of the extra, retained fluid. 
 Ultimately, it would be important to follow up with your 
primary care doctor at home - and also interventional 
radiologists (to help manage the drains) and the general 
surgeons (to plan for gallbladder removal).  Seeing your 
cardiologist would also be helpful - to help ensure your heart 
condition is optimized in preparation of the anticipated 
gallbladder surgery. 

   We wish you safe travels and good health!
