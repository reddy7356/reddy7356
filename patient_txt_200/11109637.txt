Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___.

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?
- You came to the hospital because you had a couple episodes of 
fainting.

WHAT HAPPENED WHILE I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL?
- While you were here, we ran tests to assess why you have been 
having these fainting episodes. 
- We believed your heart valve had something to do with it, and 
you were worked up for getting a replacement valve.
- Your change in Lasix dosing could also have played a role in 
your fainting. We did not give you that medication while you 
were here.

WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?
- When you leave you will have follow-up appointments. It is 
important for you to attend these. One of these appointments 
will be to check your INR level. This will help decide the 
dosing of your Warfarin. 
- Additionally, you will have some more tests scheduled for your 
eventual valve replacement surgery. 
- If you have another fainting episode, or feelings like you 
might pass out, please reach out to your cardiologist or pcp. 
- We are not sending you home on your Lasix medication. If you 
feel like you are gaining weight or becoming increasingly short 
of breath, please reach out to your medical providers for 
guidance in re-starting your Lasix.

We wish you the best!  
Your ___ Care Team

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with PMH significant for permanent
AF s/p PPM ___ for sick sinus disease, HFrEF (EF ___ with
recent decrease in LV dysfunction, progressive AS now severe who
presents with recurrent syncope.

Patient was admitted on ___  due to syncope. At that time,
patient said had no recollection of the event and he did have
loss of bowel/bladder function at the time. There was no note
made of any seizure-like activity. Evaluated by ___ and BP noted
to be low, furosemide and lisinopril not given at the direction
of ___. Duration of LOC approximately 5 minutes. During said
admission his pacemaker was interrogated and revealed no obvious
precipitating arrhythmias at time of syncope. He remained
asymptomatic throughout his stay with no signs of volume
overload. Orthostatics were negative and carotid studies showed
no prominent stenosis. He underwent coronary angiogram on ___
with only moderate narrowing of mid LAD that was not intervened
upon. The consideration was that the syncope was secondary to
progressive AS, therefore underwent expedited TAVR work-up and
was discharged with a plan to follow-up with structural team as
an outpatient.

Today he returned to the emergency room after having had 2 (? 
Possibly 3) episodes of syncope.  The first episode occurred in
the parking lot of a restaurant after getting out of his car and
walking few steps.  The second episode occurred at home when he
was ambulating inside the house and he tried to reach the couch
to break his fall.  Since his discharge he is also noted more
exertional shortness of breath when he tried walk.  He does not
complain of any exertional chest pressure.  Denies any
palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
====================
PATIENT SUMMARY:
====================
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with PMH significant for permanent
AF s/p PPM ___ for sick sinus disease, HFrEF (EF ___. He 
was recently admitted for progressive AS and discharge with plan 
for TAVR. However, he presented with recurrent syncope with 
minimal exertion and therefore was admitted for expedited workup 
and in-patient TAVR. He underwent TAVR on ___ without any 
acute complications.

====================
ACUTE ISSUES:
====================
# Severe aortic stenosis s/p TAVR
Patient has a known history of aortic stenosis. He was recently 
admitted for syncope in which his pacemaker was interrogated and 
revealed no obvious precipitating arrhythmias at the time of 
syncope. Orthostatics were negative and carotid studies showed 
no prominent stenosis. He underwent coronary angiogram on ___ 
with only moderate narrowing of mid LAD and was not intervened 
upon. He remained asymptomatic throughout his previous stay with 
no signs of volume overload. He was discharged with a plan to 
follow-up with the structural heart team for outpatient TAVR. 
Nonetheless, patient with multiple episodes of syncope with 
minimal exertion and progressive
shortness of breath and therefore he was re-admitted for 
expedited workup and in-patient TAVR. On ___ underwent 29mm 
___ 3 TAVR with no complications. He was discharged home with 
close follow up.

# Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF ___
Mr. ___ has history of HFrEF with EF of ___ per TTE on 
___. Likely etiology was considered to be worsening aortic 
stenosis. On previous admission his Lasix was held as he was not 
overloaded. Upon readmission the patient remained euvolemic with 
borderline low BPs. His diuretic and afterload reducing 
medications were held. Throughout his admission patient remained 
asymptomatic and euvolemic. Upon discharge patient asymptomatic 
and bormal BP so he will be discharged on optimized GDMT.

# Permanent atrial fibrillation
He has a pacemaker placed in ___. CHADsVASc score of 5. On 
home warfarin. Appropriately rate controlled throughout 
admission and will be discharged on home warfarin regimen.

====================
CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================
#Macrocytic anemia - unclear etiology
Noted on previous admission. Workup with B12, folate, and 
ferritin WNL. TIBC and transferrin were only slightly low. No 
obvious source of bleeding on this admission. Discharge Hgb was 
7.7. 

#Osteoarthrosis 
- Tylenol for pain as needed

#Vascular disease 
- continued ASA and atorvastatin

====================
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
====================
