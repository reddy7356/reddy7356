TECHNIQUE:  Intravenous contrast was administered and arterial 
phase imaging 
was acquired.  Coronal, sagittal and oblique reformats were 
provided. 
  
FINDINGS: 
  
CTA CHEST:  The pulmonary vasculature is well opacified and

is not well 
assessed on the prior study as patient was intubated at that 
time.  There is 
bronchial wall thickening, most evident in the lower lobes.  
Airways are not 
well assessed on prior study due to collapsed pulmonary 
parenchyma and large 
effusion, but finding is likely chronic.  Background moderate 
emphysema is 
again noted.  No opacifications concerning for pneumonia 
identified.  No 
pleural effusion or pneumothorax is evident.

2.  Background emphysema with bronchial wall thickening, 
particularly evident 
in the lower lobes likely represents a chronic 
bronchitis/bronchiolitis 
possibly due to smoking.  No focal opacification concerning for 
pneumonia. 
3.  A 4 mm polypoid soft tissue density in the anterior trachea 
at the level 
of clavicles.  Recommend non-emergent evaluation with direct 
visualization. 
4.  A 1.4 cm smoothly rounded soft tissue density in the medial 
aspect of the 
left breast, unchanged compared to ___.  Recommend 
correlation with 
mammogram.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:

Ms. ___ is a ___ former smoker (mother died of COPD) w EtOH 
cirrhosis and recent extended hospitalization (___) for 
massive variceal bleed & visceral perforation with placement of 
___ tube. She presented with 2w of worsening SOB and was 
admitted out of concern for COPD/asthma exacerbation vs CHF.

She was admitted on ___ with shortness of breath. 
Evidently her symptoms began soon after returning home from a 
rehabilitation facility, following her hospital stay here from 
___ to ___ for a bleeding crisis due to 
alcohol-induced liver disease. She experienced increasing 
shortness of breath while at home, and saw her primary care 
physician for that symptom on ___. She had a chest X-ray 
performed, which showed some lung disease (emphysema and chronic 
bronchitis, likely associated with past smoking (quit ___ years 
ago), but no evidence of pneumonia. On admission, her CBC was 
notable for WBC 6.2 with eosinophilia 10.1%; after 
administration of prednisone her eosinophilia resolved to WBC 
6.9 Eo 1.2. We believe her shortness of breath was due either to 
an exacerbation of her asthma or to an exacerbation of COPD. 
While in the hospital she initially required supplemental 
oxygen. She was treated with a prednisone taper (started at 40 
mg), and her symptoms improved quickly. She also received 
albuterol nebulizer treatments, azithromycin (empiric pneumonia 
coverage and anti-inflammatory) and fexofenadine to help 
mitigate any allergic triggers of the asthma. Even as her 
respiratory symptoms improved, her oxygen saturation continued 
to drop to 85% when she walked short distances. We therefore 
held her in the hospital for an extra day; on the evening of ___ 
___ she was able to maintain oxygen saturation of 92% while 
walking. She was discharged the following day, ___.

ACTIVE ISSUES:

SOB: Eosinophilia and high bicarbonate with CT imaging 
suggesting chronic bronchitis and no focal opacification 
concerning for pneumonia raised concern for COPD flare (perhaps 
also asthma flare). Possibly triggered by dust or dog at home. 
She was treated with prednisone 40 mg PO on a 10-day taper, 
albuterol nebulizers, azithromycin (5d course). Her peak flow 
was measured to be 100 (down from baseline >400) on ___ ___. She 
was also prescribed fexofenadine to mitigate any allergic 
component of this flare and as prophylaxis as she returns home. 
Consider long-term therapy with fluticasone as outpatient.

Cardiac Function: Little clinical concern for diastolic heart 
failure or fluid overload. Her proBNP was high, but decreased 
relative to ___ values:
___ 21:35    382 
___ 05:52    606 
TTE and further workup were not pursued after she improved with 
steroid therapt.

CHRONIC ISSUES:

Liver Disease: Alcoholic cirrhosis sp massive variceal bleeds 
(on nadolol, Lasix, spironolactone) and complicated by hepatic 
encephalopathy (on Rifaximin) sp TIPS procedure. Her liver 
disease was not addressed during this admission, and she was 
maintained on her home regimen:
Nadolol 20 mg
Furosemide 20 mg
Spironolactone 50 mg 
Lactulose: Concern for hepatic encephalopathy, no asterixis, 
given once, resulted in diarrhea and poor continence, 
subsequently held.
Rifaximin 550 mg
Active type & screen were maintained, IV access was maintained 
until discharge as a precaution.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:

Incidentalomas:

# CT chest from ___ shows a 4mm lesion in the trachea at 
level of the clavicles, non-urgent direct visualization 
recommended. Should f/u with ENT.

# CT chest from ___ shows a 1.4 cm smoothly rounded soft 
tissue density in the medial aspect of the left breast, 
correlation with mammogram recommended in outpatient setting.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a privilege to participate in your care while you were a 
patient on the Medicine Service at the ___ 
___. 
Please find here a summary description of the care you received 
while you were a patient here, together with instructions for 
continuing your care after you leave the hospital. 
Please accept my best wishes for your recovery.
Sincerely,
___ ___

You were admitted on ___ with shortness of breath. 
Evidently your symptoms began soon after you returned home from 
a rehabilitation facility, following your hospital stay here 
from ___ to ___ for the bleeding crisis due to your 
liver disease. You experienced increasing shortness of breath 
while at home, and saw your primary care physician for that 
symptom on ___. You had a chest X-ray performed, which 
showed some lung disease (emphysema and chronic bronchitis, 
likely associated with your past smoking), but no evidence of 
pneumonia. We believe your shortness of breath is due either to 
an exacerbation of your asthma, or to an exacerbation of the 
chronic bronchitis seen on your chest X-ray. While in the 
hospital, you initially required supplemental oxygen. You were 
treated with prednisone, and your symptoms improved quickly. You 
also received albuterol nebulizer treatments, and azithromycin, 
an antibiotic that was given in case of pneumonia and that is 
also used for its anti-inflammatory effects in the lungs. We 
also prescribed fexofenadine, an antihistamine medication that 
may help mitigate any allergic triggers of your asthma. Even as 
your respiratory symptoms improved, your oxygen saturation 
continued to drop to 85% when you walked short distances. We 
therefore held you in the hospital for an extra day; on the 
evening of ___ you were able to maintain oxygen 
saturation of 91-92% while walking. You were discharged the 
following day, ___.

The following are some important instructions for continuing 
your care after you leave the hospital:
1. Please continue to take all of the medications prescribed for 
your liver disease, and continue to follow up with your liver 
doctors.
2. Please continue to take the prednisone until you complete the 
10-day taper begun the day you were admitted.
3. Please follow up with your primary care physician.

      INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME. 

IMAGING
___ CXR (PORTABLE)
CONCLUSION: 
1.  Improvement of right lower lung consolidation/atelectasis. 
2.  Unchanged small left lower lung consolidation.  There is no 
new opacity. 

___ CXR (PORTABLE)
FINDINGS:  The atelectasis at the right lung base has slightly 
increased ___ extent.  The tracheostomy tube is unchanged.  The 
Dobbhoff catheter has been pulled back.  The tip now becomes 
visible slightly proximal of the duodenojejunal plica.  There is 
no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax. 

___ CXR (PORTABLE)
FINDINGS:  ___ comparison with study of ___, there is now a 
tracheostomy tube ___ place.  There is no evidence of 
pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. 
  
There is some increasing opacification at the right base.  This 
most likely reflects a combination of layering effusion and 
atelectasis.  However, ___ the appropriate clinical setting, 
supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  Less 
prominent opacification at the left base most likely represents 
atelectasis, though again infection would have to be considered. 

  
There is some increased indistinctness of engorged pulmonary 
vessels, 
consistent with some increasing pulmonary venous pressure. 

___ PORTABLE ABDOMEN
FINDINGS: 
Supine portable radiograph of the abdomen was acquired.  The 
___ tube is seen with the tip ___ the pylorus.  Air is seen 
distending the small bowel with changes suggestive of bowel wall 
edema.  The TIPS shunt is seen ___ the right upper quadrant. 
IMPRESSION: ___ tube with tip at pylorus. 

___ LIVER ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Cirrhotic liver.  Patent TIPS with appropriate velocities.   

2.  Possible isolated dilated intrahepatic duct with dilatation 
of the common duct to 7 mm.  Of note, the common duct previously 
measured 4 mm on ultrasound from ___.  Further 
evaluation could be performed with repeat ultrasound, with a 
radiologist present. 
3.  Gallbladder debris.  Otherwise, normal-appearing 
gallbladder. 
4.  Left pleural effusion, as seen on prior CT. 

___ CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: 
  
1.  No evidence of hemorrhage or infarction 
  
2.  Atrophy. 

___ CHEST (PORTABLE)
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___: 
  
Aeration at the right lung base which worsened from ___ 
through 
___, has returned to baseline.  There is still reason 
for concern 
about cause of a persistent right basal atelectasis, 
specifically aspiration and retained secretions.  
Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is present, not 
surprising for this longstanding atelectasis.  ___ the left lung 
peribronchial opacification ___ the lower lobes has improved, 
quite likely another finding due to aspiration.  Heart size is 
normal.  ET tube and left subclavian line are ___ standard 
placements and a feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of 
view.  No pneumothorax. 

___ R WRIST
RIGHT WRIST, FOUR VIEWS:  Cast material limits evaluation of 
bony detail.  There is re-demonstration of a comminuted distal 
radial fracture, with intra-articular extension.  As before, 
there is slight dorsal displacement of the dominant distal 
fracture fragment, although the distal radius articulates 
appropriately with the carpal bones.  The fracture lines are 
less conspicuous on today's study compared to the prior study 
from ___.  There is no acute fracture or 
dislocation. 
IMPRESSION:  Healing distal right radial fracture, with 
unchanged alignment. 

___ ESOPHAGUS 
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Severe gastroesophageal reflux. 
2.  No extraluminal leakage of contrast was noted. 
ESOPHAGUS

___ CT ABD AND PELVIS
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Extensive pneumoperitoneum and retroperitoneal free air with 
a small 
amount of free air seen ___ the mediastinum.  Findings are 
concerning for 
perforation at the level of the gastroesophageal junction given 
the pattern of free air distribution.  Exact site of perforation 
cannot be identified. 
2.  Extensive air within the subcutaneous tissues of the lower 
chest and 
abdominal wall bilaterally, likely direct extension from the 
intraperitoneal  process. 
3.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with associated

___ EGD: 
Findings: Esophagus:  
 Protruding Lesions 2 cords of grade II varices were seen with 
active bleeding sites at 30cm and 35cm. Upon entering the 
esophagus, no bands from prior endoscopy this AM were present. 
Attempts were made at band ligation (5 successful bands were 
deployed at first attempt, 3 additional bands were placed at 
second attempt), but hemostasis could not be achieved with 
banding. Therefore, a Minnesota tube was placed at 29cm from the 
lip.   
Stomach:  
Contents: Clotted and old blood was seen ___ the stomach with no 
evidence of active bleeding.  
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 
Impression: Varices at the 30 and 35cm
Blood ___ the stomach
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

___ EGD:
Findings: Esophagus:  
 Protruding Lesions 2 cords of grade II varices were seen ___ the 
esophagus. One varix had ruptured with active bleeding. 2 bands 
were placed for hemostasis successfully.  
 Other A medium hiatal hernia was seen.  
Stomach:  
 Protruding Lesions A fundal varix was seen. There did not 
appear to be active bleeding.  
Duodenum: Normal duodenum. 
Impression: Esophageal varices
Gastric varices
A medium hiatal hernia was seen.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum 

___ EGD:
Findings: Esophagus:  
 Other There was active and fast bleeding ___ the esophagus. 
There was also evidence of esophageal necrosis. Given that 
banding has not worked multiple times ___ the past 24 hours, the 
decision was made to use sclerosing agent (Tetradecaly sulfate 
2cc was injected at the site of active bleed), but hemostasis 
was not acheived. 2cc glue injection was then done. At this 
time, it was noted that the patient's abdomen was firm and 
distended, with swelling up to chest and neck ___ conjunction 
with respiratory decompensation. The procedure was then aborted.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ F hx of EtOH abuse and hypertension, admitted with right 
radial fracture and scalp laceration after mechanical fall and 
found to have ETOH hepatitis and undiagnosed cirrhosis. She 
subsequently developed a rapid variceal bleed requiring massive 
transfusion protocol, banding, TIPS and ___ placement 
complicated by esophageal perforation managed by 
intra-esophageal glue.  She became progressively deconditioned 
and frequently aspirated requiring intubation 3 times over her 
40 day hospital course for mixed hypoxic and hypercarbic 
respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy placement.

# Massive variceal bleed: On the floor patient was noted to have 
a nine-point Hct drop on ___. EGD showed active variceal bleed 
which was banded. She was started on octeotride and pantoprazole 
drips. Despite this, patient continued to have active, 
hemodynamically significant bleed requiring intubation, massive 
transfusion protocol and ___ placement. She required a 
total of 11u prBCS, 9u FFP, 1u plt, and 2u cryo. She underwent 
successful emergent TIPS on ___ but continued to have bleeding 
immediately post-procedure. Susbequent imaging showed that TIPS 
remained patent. Repeat endoscopy was performed at that time 
which showed continued bleeding ___ the stomach and the esophagus 
and prior bands were not visualized. Esophageal necrosis was 
also noted at the time, thought to be related to recent 
___ placement. Sclerosing agent was blindly injected but 
hemostasis could not be achieved. The procedure had to be 
aborted as patient began to show signs of respiratory 
decompensation and subcutaneous air ___ the neck and free air ___ 
the abdomen. This was confirmed on post-procedure CXR. Despite 
this, patient remained hemodynamically stable with no signs of 
further bleed. Octeotride and pantoprazole drips were 
discontinued. She was treated with ciprofloxacin for SBP 
prophylaxis ___ the setting of her bleed. She spiked intermittent 
fevers and had a persistent leukocytosis so her antibiotics were 
broadened to linezolid after cultures from a groin bag returned 
VRE, thought to be of a peritoneal source. However, these 
cultures were not sterilely obtained so they could have been 
contaminated. She was transferred to the medical floor on ___ 
and had no recurrence of hematemesis, but was noted to have a 
slowly downtrending HCT and was transfused an additional unit of 
PRBCs on ___. Pt was again transfused ___ and ___ for 
gradually decreasing hematocrit. Patient's anemia is macrocytic 
most likely secondary to liver disease; normal folate and vit 
b12; LDH and hapto normal making hemolysis unlikely. Iron 
studies shows anemia of chronic disease. Stools were guaic on 
___ and ___ and were negative. Her hematocrit has then 
remained stable for the rest of the hospitalization.  

# Perforated viscus: Following repeat EGD, patient had evidence 
of free air ___ the neck and under the diaphragm. CT Abdomen was 
obtained which showed no obvious location of perforated viscus 
but possible contained leak near the gastro-esophageal junction. 
Surgery was consulted who felt there was no need for acute 
intervention given patient's stability. Antibiotics were 
broadened to flagyl, vancomycin, and fluconazole for a seven-day 
course to cover any viscus rupture (see below for further 
antibiotic course). She was kept NPO and TPN was initiated. She 
underwent esophagram with gastrograffin which showed no 
extraluminal leakage of contrast, but severe gastroesophageal 
reflux. Dobhoff was placed with ___ guidance to minimize trauma 
to the esophagus on ___ and tube feeding was initiated. 
Bedside speech and swallow evaluation was requested but deferred 
as negative gastrograffin swallow was felt to be sufficient for 
such evaluation. She was again made strict NPO after aspiration 
events requiring MICU transfer as described below. Her nutrition 
was kept through dobhoff and tubefeedings. 

# Persistent leukocytosis and fevers: After leaving the ICU, 
patient was noted to have low grade fevers accompanied by 
persistent leukocytosis. Infectious disease team was consulted, 
and recommended changing patient to linezolid, aztreonam, and 
flagyl for broad spectrum coverage of both pulmonary, 
intraabdominal, and other causes (patient with VRE+ groin bag as 
noted above). Patient's leukocytosis trended down and patient 
remained afebrile on antibiotics. She completed antibiotics on 
___. (metronidazole ___, aztreonam ___, 
linezolid ___. WBC acutely rose 5.5->13.8 on ___, 
attributed to possible aspiration given patient's persistent 
difficulty ___ clearing secreations. Broad spectrum coverage with 
cefepime, vancomycin and metronidazole was restarted on ___. 
WBC continued to rise and a diagnostic paracentesis was 
performed at the bedside on ___. Peritoneal fluid was negative 
for SBP by cell count. Antibiotics were continued for a full 8 
day course for HCAP (cefepime/flagyl till ___, linezolid till 
___. Patient no longer febrile and without leukocytosis 
starting ___. 
 
# Aspiration: On the floor, pt was noted to have intermittently 
labored breathing and significant difficulty clearing 
respiratory secretions due to severe deconditioning and 
waxing/waning mental status. On ___ she became acutely more 
somnolent and hypoxic ___ the setting of aspiration that resolved 
with deep suction.  She was observed ___ the MICU overnight but 
remained on nasal cannula and was transferred back to the floor. 
 Even with post-pyloric feedings she was felt to be at risk of 
aspiration given her severe reflux, increased pressure due to 
ascites, weakness and poor cough from prolonged hospitalization, 
and fluctuating level of consciousness. Back on the floor, she 
was kept strict NPO and was again noted to be diffusely 
rhonchorous and unable to clear secretions effectively.  A 
scopolamine patch was considered but deferred due to concern for 
further worsening her mental status. She required frequent oral 
suctioning by nursing staff, deep suctioning by RT and chest ___. 
 She was noted to intermittently desaturate to ___ on telemetry. 
 Pt had second aspiration event and was transferred back to the 
MICU on ___. Pt treated for aspiration pneumonitis and was not 
given ABX course. She was observed ___ the ICU and transferred 
back to the medicine floor. The evening of ___, pt was again 
noted to have labored breathing and although O2 sats were 
maintained on supplemental O2, repeat ABG showed worsening 
acidemia with rising pCO2 to 68. Due to concern that she may be 
tiring out with obtundation and inability to protect her 
airwayd, she was again transferred to the MICU and was 
intubated.  Due to her multiple intubations secondary to poor 
conditioning and inability to protect her airway, she went for 
tracheostomy placement on ___. She did well after tracheostomy 
placement and satting well with tracheostomy mask; this should 
not be downsized until a minimum of 10 days post-op. Continues 
to have productive secretions requiring constant suctioning, 
however secretions and lung exam with significant improvement 
from prior days. Most recent CXR on ___ without new acute 
changes.  

# Delirium/hepatic encephalopathy: During ICU stay as well as on 
the floor, patient was noted to be hallucinating, with signs of 
paranoia and inattention. Patient was, at times, interfering 
with care. Psychiatry was consulted, who ascertained the patient 
to be delirious, likely secondary to hepatic and other 
toxic/metabolic ongoing insults. CT head without hemorrhage or 
edema. A low dose antipsychotic was considered, but patient's 
QTc was prolonged. Other alternatives were all oral, and while 
patient was strictly NPO at that time, these were unable to be 
used. The decision was made to pursue care plan as detailed 
above with hope that patient would begin to clear as her 
clinical picture improved. Pt's mental status improved to the 
extent that she was no longer noted to have hallucinations or 
inattention on the floor. However, mental status waxed and waned 
and patient was intermittently less responsive to verbal 
stimulation, but at other times was AAO to person and place and 
able to answer questions appropriately. She was started on 
lactulose and rifaximin. Her lactulose was uptitrated to achieve 
1L of stools per day. Her mental status improved with the 
lactulose. Her flexseal was discontinued on ___ and a fecal 
incontinence pouch was placed. 

# extremities edema: patient with 2++ pitting edema ___ all four 
extremities. Weight is 59kg from admission 52kg. Also has been 
net positive since MICU. As a result, diuretics were uptitrated 
to 80mg daily and spironolactone to 200mg dialy. ___ addition, 
her fluid flushes which was initially increased due to 
hypernatremia was decreased to 100cc q4h as patient was no 
longer hypernatremic. 

# Deconditioning: Pt noted to be extremely weak on medical floor 
with ___ strength ___ all four extremities, likely due to severe 
illness and prolonged hospitalization with bedrest. Physical 
therapy was consulted, noted limited ablility to
participate ___ therapy due to profound deconditioning and 
recommended eventual discharge to rehab.  Tube feeds were begun 
with high caloric content to improve her nutrition ___ the hopes 
of reversing her deconditioning. At discharge continued to be 
very weak with ___ strength throughout. She is profoundly weak 
and will require rather extensive rehabilitation and physical 
therapy.  Continued nutrition will be essential; albumin is 2. 

# Goals of Care: Pt had strong family support with frequent 
visitors. Multiple family meetings were held.  Her HCP, ___ 
___ (___) continued to reaffirm her code status as 
full code.

# Alcoholic hepatitis: Given clinical history ETOH hepatitis is 
most likely explanation of elevated AST/ALT. Discriminant 
function 42 on admission but patient was never started on 
steroids due to her acute GI bleed. 

# EtOH Cirrhosis: New diagnosis this admission, likely related 
to alcohol. AFP negative. EGD showed 2 cords of grade II varices 
on ___ with active bleeding, s/p TIPS. Her last TIPS 
patency study was on ___ and was patent.  She also had 
complications of encephalopathy and ascites, requiring 
paracenteses.  She is not discharged on nadolol due to her TIPS. 
 She was initially receiving daily lasix 40mg IV for diuresis 
and initiated on spironolactone and lasix when dobhoff was 
placed. MELD score of 11 and ___ class B. No PVT per 
ultrasound. Hepatitis panel negative, ___ negative. Anti 
smooth muscle antibody positive, but titer not significant 1:20. 
She was treated with rifaximin/lactulose as per above. Diuretics 
were uptitrated as per above. Nadolol 20mg BID was started for 
variceal bleed prevention; was not further uptitrated given that 
BP at low 100s at times and ___ process of titrating diuretics. 
Treated with lansoprazole, paracentesis for comfort, SBP ppx 
with cipro 250mg daily. Patient will follow-up with her 
hepatologist ___ ___ one month after discharge.

# Nutrition: patient on trach mask and enteric feeding via 
dobhoff on ___. Can downsize trach after ___. Will need to 
evaluate with speech and swallow to restart po intake. 

# Wrist fracture: Right distal radius fracture was closed 
reduced and splinted with hematoma block. Ortho recommended 
follow-up ___ 4 weeks post-discharge ___ (the week 
of ___
