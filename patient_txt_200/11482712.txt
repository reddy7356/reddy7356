History of Present Illness:
___ year old female with a history significant for IVDA (on 
suboxone but pt endorses using heroin actively) who was found by 
her parents ___ her room somnolent. She was taken to ___ 
___ and on admission, she had AMS, low BP, fevers, 
tachycardia. Lumbar puncture was performed with 33wbc, 362 rbc, 
glc 57, total protein 60. Head imaging was positive for septic 
emboli, and she also has ___ lesions on exam. Blood cultures 
from ___ grew GPC ___ clusters. She received 1g vanc, 2g CTX, 
and 700mg IV acyclovir. She was admitted to the medicine floor 
and she was mentating well and vital signs were stable until she 
developed hypotension. A right femoral CV was placed and she was 
taken to the MICU, where she responded to IVF. She was 
transferred to ___ for further management of fever, 
tachycardia, hypotension ___ the setting of presumed 
endocarditis. At ___, her EKG showed intermittent junctional 
rhythm and echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetation. MRI

intolerance. Neurology was consulted and recommended MRI/MRA 
head and neck and EEG given extensive septic emboli. A TEE was 
done and showed a large vegetation on mitral valve and a

ECHO ___: The left atrium and right atrium are normal ___ 
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging 
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. No 
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot 
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral 
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral 
regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral 
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image 
quality. No masses or vegetations are seen on the tricuspid 
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image 
quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 
normal. IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal study. 
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global 
biventricular systolic function. No valvular pathology or 
pathologic flow identified.

pleural 
effusions are improved with resolution of previous pulmonary 
edema.  The

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ ___ with a history of intravenous drug 
abuse, who presented with MSSA endocarditis.  Initially it was 
medically managed.  On TEE from ___ she was found to have a 
very large, mobile vegetation ___ the mitral valve which was 
extremely labile with the risk of embolization. She was also 
found to have multiple embolic infarcts ___ the brain.  The 
mitral valve regurgitation was
only mild. There were more vegetations on the tricuspid valve. 
Again, the tricuspid valve regurgitation was mild. After initial 
medical management, it was decided to take her to the operating 
room ___ view of the extremely mobile vegetation with evidence of 
emboli.  The left ventricular function was well-preserved. On 
___ 
the ___ was brought to the operating room and underwent a 
Mitral valve repair, tricuspid valve debridement and PFO 
closure. Overall the ___ tolerated the procedure well and 
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU ___ stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the 
___ extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. 
The ___ was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable 
on no inotropic or vasopressor support. Low dose beta blocker 
was initiated and the ___ was gently diuresed toward the 
preoperative weight. ID followed the ___ and she will be 
treated with Nafcillin for 6 weeks from her operation (___). 
 She also had +HCV diagnosis this admission with viral load of 
259,637 IU/mL.  The ___ was transferred to the telemetry 
floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were 
discontinued without complication. The ___ was evaluated by 
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and 
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 6 the ___ was 
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled 
with oral analgesics.  The ___ was discharged to the ___ 
___ ___ good condition with appropriate follow up 
instructions.
