___ x-ray R elbow:
FINDINGS: There is a linear longitudinal lucency seen along the 
radial head
on the oblique views only with no associated abnormal joint 
effusions of
uncertain clinical significance. No dislocation, or degenerative 
change is
detected. No lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified. No soft 
tissue
calcifications or radiopaque foreign bodies are seen.
. 
IMPRESSION: Linear longitudinal lucency along the radial head 
with no
associated joint effusion of uncertain clinical significance. 
Subtle
underlying fracture cannot be excluded. Recommend clinical 
correlation and
follow- up imaging can be obtained as indicated.
.
CT RUE: Final read pending. Study suboptimal due to patient's 
body habitus and does not fit well into CT scanner.  No clear 
evidence of fracture but cannot be ruled out. No effusion 
present.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a ___ yo male with history of Roux-en-Y Gastric 
bypass and multiple infections of left lower extremity and right 
shoulder who presented with a right arm cellulitis s/p a fall 
and laceration.
.
His cellulitis was treated with IV vancomycin while in the 
hospital. His cellulitis receded compared to a border drawn in 
some areas and slightly extended beyond the borders in one area. 
 Over all his cellulitis looked much improved overnight and he 
had less pain when moving his arm.  His WBC was 12.3 on 
admission and within the normal range on discharge.  The patient 
stated that all his previous episodes of cellulitis have been 
treated with cephalexin.  He was discharged on a 10 day course 
of cephalexin 500mg PO qid.  He was also given 4 oxycodone 5mg 
pills to take for pain and instructed not to drive while on the 
oxycodone.  He was also discharged on the tylenol her takes for 
his OA and back pain.
.
A elbow arm x-ray was done which showed a linear longitudinal 
lucency along the radial head with no associated joint effusion. 
 An underlying fracture could not be excluded. A CT scan of the 
upper extremity without contrast was done but the results were 
suboptimal as the patient's body habitus limited the quality of 
the study.  The final read is still pending but on wet read 
there was no fracture or effusion.  However, the possibility of 
fracture could not be excluded.  The patient was told that if he 
continued to have pain in 5 to 7 days he should call his PCP and 
arrange for a repeat x-ray to look for fracture.
.
He had a previous roux-en-Y Gastric bypass surgery and was 
continued on his MVI, calcium, and vit D while in the hospital.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because of pain and swelling 
of your right elbow which was felt to be due to a skin 
infection, cellulitis. You were treated overnight with 
intravenous antibiotics and pain medication. On discharge you 
were switched to an oral antibiotic called cephalexin. It is 
important that you complete the full course of antibiotics.  You 
are being discharged on oxycodone for pain but you cannot drive 
when taking this medication because it makes you sleepy.  We did 
an x-ray of your arm and it is unclear if you had a fracture- 
fractures do not always show up on x-ray so soon after the 
fracture. We did a CT scan on your elbow and as far as we could 
see there was no fracture- however this study was somewhat 
limited by your body size.  If you have continued pain in ___ 
days please call your PCP and getting ___ follow up x-ray to look 
for fracture.
.
No other changes were made to your medications. You should 
continue to take all medications as prescribed and keep all 
doctor's appointments.

If you experience worsening pain, spreading of the redness on 
your arm, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, joint 
pain, or if you feel worse in any way, seek immediate medical 
attention.
