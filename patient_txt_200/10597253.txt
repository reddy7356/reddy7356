Ms. ___ is a ___ G2P2 who presented with clear SROM, early 
labor, GBS positive, and desire for trial of labor.  She 
underwent pitocin and had successful VBAC that was complicated 
by postpartum hemorrhage and DIC requiring hysterectomy. A 
hysterectomy was required due to persistent hemorrhage despite 
uterotonics, D&C, bakri balloon, B-lynch, and box stitch. 
Massive transfusion protocol was required.  She had also 
developed hives intraoperatively, which was thought to either be 
due to a reaction to products received or possible AFE.  EBL was 
4000mL.  Intraoperatively, total products received were 8 units 
pRBCs (of which 1 unit was interrupted due to possible 
transfusion reaction), ___ FFP, 3 platelets and 2 cryoprecipitate. 
Please see operative note for full details.  

She was admitted to the FICU postoperatively where she continued 
to be monitored:
- For the postpartum hemorrhage/DIC/hemorrhagic shock/blood loss 
anemia, she received short course of pressors and additional 2 
units of pRBCs.  Fibrinogen nadired to 82 and normalized later 
pod#0.  After transfusion, hct remained stable at ___ without 
any evidence of ongoing bleeding. In total over hospitalization, 
pt received 9 to 10 units of PRBCs, 3 Platelets, 2 
Cryoprecipitate, ___ FFP.
- Presumed sepsis was managed with IV vancomycin and zosyn until 
over 24hours afebrile. No source was identified while in the 
hospital. Urine and blood cultures were all negative and WBC 
normalized.

Patient was extubated on pod#1 and transferred to the normal 
postpartum floor on pod#2. By pod#2 patient was ambulating,
