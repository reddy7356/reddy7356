PRE-BYPASS: 

The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo 
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. No atrial 
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left 
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 25 
%). 

Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free 
wall hypokinesis. 

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic 
aorta is mildly dilated. 

The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are 
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to moderate (___) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. 

The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate 
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial 
effusion. Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results at 
time of surgery. 

POST-BYPASS:

The patient is A paced. The patient is on norepinephine and 
epinephrine infusions.

Left ventricular function is unchanged, estimated EF is 25%. 
Right ventricular function is mildly improved.

There is a well-seated mechanical prosthetic valve in the aortic 
position. Characteristic washing jets are seen. The leaflets are 
normally mobile. The peak gradient across the aortic valve is 
18mmHg, the mean gradient is 9mmHg with CO of 4L/min.

There is a mitral annuloplasty ring in place. There is a mean 
gradient of 2 mmHg across the mitral valve at a cardiac output 
of 4L/min. No mitral regurgitation is seen.

There is a tube graft in the ascending aortic position. The 
aortic arch and descending aorta are intact post-decannulation.  
 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the Operating Room on ___ where surgery was 
performed as noted.  See operative note for details.  He weaned 
from bypass on Epinephrine, Propofol and Levophed.  He remained 
stable, was extubated and over 48 hours weaned from pressors.

He transferred to the floor on POD 2 and Physical Therapy worked 
with him.  Coumadin was begun and Heparin started on POD 3.  He 
was diuresed towards his preoperative weight and Coreg was 
started and titrated as BP allowed. No ACE_I was given as BP was 
too low to allow it.

Mediastinal CTs were removed per protocol, as were pacing wires, 
however, pleural CTs remained in until ___ due to drainage.  At 
discharge he was ambulatory , follow up appointments were 
arranged and Coumadin follow up by Dr. ___ arranged as well.
