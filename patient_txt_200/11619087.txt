Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F DM1, CKD, hyperlipidemia who presents with diarrhea, 
vomiting and developed witnessed seizure in ED. 
.
# Peripheral Vascular Disease - Pt was a known patient of Dr. 
___ was seen by the vascular team after admission. 
She was noted to have resting pain in her lower extremities and 
was worked up for this issue. Noninvasive vascular studies were 
c/w peripheral vascular disease and the patient was taken to the 
angio suite where she underwent angiography and balloon 
angioplasty of her previously existing graft. She tolerated the 
procedure and recovered from anesthesia without complication. 
She was observed postoperatively and was discharged to home with 
a creatinine of 1.0 
. 
# Seizure: No prior history per OMR or family. Unlikely to be 
secondary to electrolyte abnormalities (Na normal on admission) 
and hypoglycemia (glucose normal). Less likely to be Alcohol 
withdrawal or illicit medications as no prior history and 
serum/urine toxicology essential normal. Patient recently 
suffering from gastroenteritis, certain viral etiologies can 
infect CSF and result in menigitis. Other etiologies on the 
differential include structural mass or CVA but CT head and MRI 
head were within normal limits. EEG (24 hour) was performed, per 
neurology recs, which showed preliminarily no seizure activity, 
positive encephalopathy. Lumbar puncture was performed which was 
negative for meningitis. Patient's citalopram, gabapentin, 
lorazepam, reglan and chantix were initially held for 
possibility of lowering seizure threshold. They were slowly 
added back, starting with gabapentin and reglan as patient 
clinically improved. 
.
# Diarrhea, vomiting: Most likely gastroenteritis. However based 
on CAD/DM history patient was ruled out for inferior MI and EKGs 
within normal limits. 
.
# Hypertension: Seizure could be result of PRES (posterior 
reversible encephalopathy syndrome). HTN as outpatient 
significantly lower, SBP100-154. Patient's BP dropped from 230 
to 130 in ED following propofol. Once extubated, patient's blood 
pressures climbed to SBP180s which, per patient, is her 
baseline. She was resumed on her home lisinopril 10mg daily and 
given hydralazine 10mg IV as needed while in the MICU for 
management of her blood pressures. 
.
# Chronic pain: Gave IV morphine during MICU stay. Of note, has 
PCP in ___, who Rx's 40 mg oxycontin QAM, 10 mg QPM & oxyocodone 
___ mg daily PRN. Restarted patient on oxycontin 10 mg BID with 
good effect
.
# DM1: Continued on long acting glargine and insulin sliding 
scale, per ___ recs.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Simvastatin 40 mg qpm
.
# Hypothyroid: Continued levothyroxine. 
.
# CKD: Creatinine around baseline 1.2-1.5. 
.
# Depression: Hold meds that decrease seizure threshold.
.
# Autonomic orthostatic hypotension: NaCl 2 gram BID was 
discontinued in setting of hypertension. 
.
# Code:  Full
.

pieces of tape called steri-strips over the incision. These will 
stay on about a week and you may shower with them on. If these 
do not fall off after 10 days, you may peel them off with warm 
water and soap in the shower.
Avoid taking a tub bath, swimming, or soaking in a hot tub for 
four weeks after surgery. 
MEDICATIONS: 
Unless told otherwise you should resume taking all of the 
medications you were taking before surgery. You will be given a 
new prescription for pain medication, which can be taken every 
three (3) to four (4) hours only if necessary. 
Remember that narcotic pain meds can be constipating and you 
should increase the fluid and bulk foods in your diet. (Check 
with your physician if you have fluid restrictions.) If you feel 
that you are constipated, do not strain at the toilet. You may 
use over the counter Metamucil or Milk of Magnesia. Appetite 
suppression may occur; this will improve with time. Eat small 
balanced meals throughout the day.
CAUTIONS:
NO SMOKING! We know you've heard this before, but it really is 
an important step to your recovery. Smoking causes narrowing of 
your blood vessels which in turn decreases circulation. If you 
smoke you will need to stop as soon as possible. Ask your nurse 
or doctor for information on smoking cessation.
Avoid pressure to your amputation site.
No strenuous activity for 6 weeks after surgery. 
DIET:
There are no special restrictions on your diet postoperatively. 
Poor appetite is expected for several weeks and small, frequent 
meals may be preferred. 
For people with vascular problems we would recommend a 
cholesterol lowering diet: Follow a diet low in total fat and 
low in saturated fat and in cholesterol to improve lipid profile 
in your blood. Additionally, some people see a reduction in 
serum cholesterol by reducing dietary cholesterol. Since a 
reduction in dietary cholesterol is not harmful, we suggest that 
most people reduce dietary fat, saturated fat and cholesterol to 
decrease total cholesterol and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein-the 
bad cholesterol). Exercise will increase your HDL (High Density 
Lipoprotein-the good cholesterol) and with your doctor's 
permission, is typically recommended. You may be self-referred 
or get a referral from your doctor. 
If you are overweight, you need to think about starting a weight 
management program. Your health and its improvement depend on 
it. We know that making changes in your lifestyle will not be 
easy, and it will require a whole new set of habits and a new 
attitude. If interested you can may be self-referred or can get 
a referral from your doctor. 
If you have diabetes and would like additional guidance, you may 
request a referral from your doctor.
___ APPOINTMENT: 
Be sure to keep your medical appointments. The key to your 
improving health will be to keep a tight reign on any of the 
chronic medical conditions that you have. Things like high blood 
pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol are major villains to 
the blood vessels. Don't let them go untreated! 
Please call the office on the first working day after your 
discharge from the hospital to schedule a ___ visit. This 
should be scheduled on the calendar for seven to fourteen days 
after discharge. Normal office hours are ___ 
through ___.
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL THE OFFICE WITH ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR 
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE

 #Hypertension: this was investigated on her last admission  
 during which she was noted to be hypertensive on her home  
 regimen. The hydralazine was initially increased to TID. 
However  
 she reported well controlled blood pressures at home and OT  
 evaluation her blood pressure was in the 110s systolic. The 
dose  
 of hydrazine was decreased back to her pre-admission dose. 
Labile  
 blood pressures due to autonomic neuropathy from diabetes is  
 likely. Labetalol dosing decreased by half. 
 Please consider starting ACEI in outpt setting if able and Cr/K 
stable.
  
 #Prolonged QTc of 500 ms: likely due to both antiemetics and  
 methadone. Improved to 469 ms. ___ held during 
admission.

Baseline cr around 2.0 since ___. FENa 3.0% so not likely 
prerenal. Specific gravity 1.013 but this was 24 hrs into 
admission. Cr up to 2.3 with elevated K up to 5.4. Continued 
calcitriol. CR improved with IVF. After discussion with pharmacy 
trialed PO Bactrim for UTI to have a PO regimen. However, 
despite decreased dosing pt continued with hyperkalemia and 
elevated Cr. Therefore, this was dc'd and pt was converted to IV 
ceftazidine to complete her course.

Discharge Instructions:
Ms. ___, 

You were admitted for a fall and passing out. This may have been 
caused by low blood pressure upon standing and possibly due to 
your medications. Your insulin dosing was adjusted as were your 
blood pressure medications.  You were also found to have a 
urinary tract infection and were given antibiotics which will 
continue for a 7 day total course. 
.
You will also be set up to see a urologist after discharge to 
discuss your issues with urination. 

You agreed to go to a rehab facility to work on improving your 
strength and stamina which have deteriorated after so many 
hospitalizations.  We think this is an excellent decision and 
wish you all the best as you continue to become stronger.  You 
will also get help in managing your medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old woman with DM type 1, PVD with significant RLE 
ischemia, R hip revision ___ admitted with N/V and abdominal 
pain and transferred to the MICU for hypertensive emergency.  

# Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency - The patient had increased 
BP's of 210's/100's in the setting of N/V, improved with 
hydralazine in ED. She has recently been off of home BP meds 
with well controlled BP's.  She was on a labetalol gtt for 
titration to BP's, and was transitioned to Chlorthalidone which 
was uptitrated as she was weaned off Labetalol gtt. She was 
previously on Lisinopril and clonidine patch as an outpatient, 
and the clonidine patch was re-started in-house and d/c'd prior 
to dispo. Her BP's came under better control and her dose of 
chlorthalidone was halved prior to discharge to prevent 
hypotension with good outpatient follow-up scheduled.

# Aphasic Episodes - AMS able to follow commands but not able to 
speak, SBP 198.  Fingerstick nl.  Labetalol 10mg IV given, gtt 
started.  CT head obtained, no acute process.  
- Had another episode of aphasia at 2pm with normal neuro exam, 
able to follow commands, but did not remember event 
subsequently.  Lasted ~20 mins and slowly recovered.  MRI head 
and continuous EEG ordered 
The patient had Suspect this is due to high BPs as pt has had no 
repeat episodes with BPs in the 160 range. Neurology called 
yesterday stating no seizure activity on EEG, can d/c EEG. 
Neurology signing off. No further episodes occurred prior to 
d/c.
.  
# N/V - Pt presented with N/V and mild abdominal pain similar to 
her prior flares of gastroparesis.  She was dehydrated on 
initial admission which improved with IVF.  She was continued on 
her home gastroparesis medications with subsequent improvement 
of her n/v and abdominal symptoms.  She was hydrated with IVF 
and diet was advanced without incident.  Of note, she had no 
clear EKG changes from prior with exception of increase ST 
depressions in the setting of hypertension with negative CE's.  
She had stool studies and cultures sent which were negative.
.  
# PVD - pt has severe ischemic rest pain of her right foot and 
nonhealing pressure ulcer of her right heel. Arteriography 
showed peripheral arterial disease and she was scheduled to have 
a fem-distal anterior tibial bypass by Dr. ___ in the 
near future, and Dr. ___ was emailed.  Her ulcer had no 
evidence of infection. She is scheduled to f/u with ___ 
___ to reschedule the surgery.  
.  
# DM Type 1 - Patient was initially in DKA which resolved on 
admission to the MICU and she was covered with ISS and Glargine. 
 The patient was subsequently continued on SSI and continued her 
home glargine rather than her home insulin pump initially, per 
patient request.  She was restarted on her home insulin pump 
prior to callout from the MICU, per patient preference, and 
___ was consulted. Recommendations were implemented and a 
follow-up appointment was set up on day of discharge.

clear of focal consolidation or effusion or pulmonary vascular 
congestion.  The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for 
technique.  Post-traumatic changes seen at the distal right 
clavicle and at the right humeral head as well. 
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
FINDINGS: 
Abdomen:  The lung bases demonstrate dependent atelectasis and 
are otherwise clear.  No pleural or pericardial effusion is 
seen.  Coronary artery calcifications are partially imaged.  
Mitral anulus calcifications are noted.    
No acute abnormality is detected of the liver, gallbladder, 
spleen, atrophic pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, visualized 
portions of the ureters, stomach, small bowel, or colon.  Mild 
prominence of the central intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary 
tree is noted.  Mild stranding around the kidneys bilaterally 
appears unchanged since ___.  There is no free intraperitoneal 
air or ascites.  The portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, and 
splenic vein appear patent.  The abdominal aorta is normal in 
caliber with patent branch vessels and severe atherosclerotic 
change.  
Pelvis:  Evaluation of intrapelvic organs is markedly limited 
due to artifact from bilateral hip hardware.  A Foley catheter 
is seen in the bladder, which contains air, likely secondary to 
instrumentation.  
Bilateral 10th rib fractures appear chronic.  No acute bony 
abnormality is detected.  Bilateral hip hardware is noted.   
IMPRESSION: 
No acute findings to explain patient's symptoms. 

___ CXR, PORTABLE AP
FINDINGS:  Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Pulmonary 
vascular 
congestion is accompanied by interstitial edema.  Hazy opacity 
in right cardiophrenic angle region probably corresponds to a 
prominent pericardial fat pad in this region shown on CT abdomen 
of ___. Small right pleural effusion is noted.

Blood Cultures from ___ pending
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with DM1, CAD, HTN, HLD who p/w nausea, somnolence, and 
chills with UTI and GNR sepsis.

# UTI with GNR Sepsis. The patient presented with nausea, 
somnolence, chills, and increased urinary frequency. In the ED, 
her UA was notable for >182 WBC, two of two blood cultures 
growing out GNRs, and WBC 9.6 with bandemia. She was initially 
treated with ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and Zosyn in the ED. This 
was narrowed to Zosyn due to GNRs growing from blood cultures. 
On discharge, blood and urine cultures demonstrated E. coli, 
sensitive to ciprofloxacin. IV fluids were given for 
resuscitation. Subsequent blood cultures were pending but so far 
negative for at least 48 hours. She was switched to 
ciprofloxacin PO on ___, and she was given a 14-day course 
(day 1 = ___ of antibiotics.

# ___. The patient's Cr steadily rose from her baseline of 
~1.4-1.5 to a high of 3.3 before trending downward. This was 
attributed to pre-renal etiology and/or ATN likely ___ sepsis. 
Her creatinine improved with IV fluids.

# Hyponatremia. The patient's Na on admission was 131. It was 
most likely secondary to sepsis and hypovolemia. She was treated 
with IV fluids, and her hyponatremia resolved.

# IDDM. The patient is on standing Lantus at home with a Humalog 
sliding scale. She reported a home baseline FSBG in the 200s. 
___ diabetes consult tailored her insulin regimen to the 
following: 14 units glargine with breakfast, 16 units glargine 
at bedtime; humalog insulin sliding scale.

# HTN. During the first few days of admission, her blood 
pressures were well-controlled on the floor with SBP in the 
140s. She was maintained on her home amlodipine and beta blocker 
was held in the setting of sepsis. Her home labetalol was 
continued before discharge with SBPs in the 140s-180s. She was 
started on hydralazine PO 10mg for episodes of high SBPs, but 
this was discontinued prior to discharge.

# Gastroparesis. Her gastroparesis was treated with her home 
Reglan, PPI, and ondansetron PRN.

# Anemia. The patient's HCT was ___ during admission and 
remained stable, given her baseline of ___.

# Low back pain, Sciatica. Well-controlled with methadone.
- Continued methadone

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were hospitalized at the ___ 
___ because you had nausea and were overall not feeling well. 
While you were in the Emergency Room, we found that you had a 
urinary tract infection and bacteria in your blood. We gave you 
antibiotics and intravenous fluids, which led to improvement in 
your symptoms. We continued to follow your blood cultures to 
monitor if any additional bacteria grew out from them, and none 
did.

You also had some kidney damage, most likely from the kidneys 
not getting enough blood flow as a result of the infection, and 
we monitored your kidney function. We gave you intravenous 
fluids that helped improve your kidney function.

It was a pleasure participating in your care.

Sincerely,
Your ___ Care Team

Imaging:
CT Cspine ___:
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of acute fracture or 
dislocation.  Similar to 
the prior study there is straightening of the normal cervical 
lordosis, 
potentially this is positional in nature.  There is no 
prevertebral or 
paravertebral soft tissue edema.  The atlantodental interval is 
preserved.  
The dens is normally positioned between the lateral masses of 
C1.  There are 
multilevel degenerative changes with anterior and posterior 
osteophytes at 
multiple levels.  Disc osteophyte complexes cause moderate 
central canal 
narrowing most prominently at C4-C5, C5-C6.  There is severe 
disc height loss 
at C3-C4 through C6-C7.  There is unchanged anterolisthesis of 
C7 on T1 which 
can be accounted for by facet joint hypertrophy at this level.  
A 0.6-cm 
ossific density in the posterior aspect of the central canal at 
C4-C5 is 
unchanged and may represent focal calcification of the 
ligamentum flavum which 
abuts the ventral cord. 
  
The included lung apices are clear.  As in the prior study the 
esophagus is 
patulous at its superior portion. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.  
Multilevel 
degenerative changes as detailed above. 

CT head non-con ___:  
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. 

Clavicle Xray ___: IMPRESSION: Acute distal right clavicular 
fracture.  Chronic deformity of the 
right humeral head. 

CXR ___: IMPRESSION:  Acute right clavicular fracture, better 
seen on dedicated images. 
No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

Hip/pelvis Xray ___: FINDINGS:  AP view of the pelvis.  AP and 
lateral views of the proximal and 
distal right femur.  Postoperative changes of left hip 
hemiarthroplasty are 
again seen.  Right femoral intramedullary rod with transfixing 
screws are 
again seen.  There is no evidence of periprosthetic lucency or 
hardware 
fracture.  There is no acute fracture identified.  Pubic 
symphysis and SI 
joints are unremarkable.  Multiple right-sided vascular stents 
are visualized 
in the lower extremity.  Surgical clips project over the right 
groin. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No visualized acute fracture. 

___ ___:
IMPRESSION: 
  
No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o F with DMI, HTN, prior MI (no stent), PVD s/ BKA, and 
recent hospitalizations admitted for Right clavicular fracture 
s/p fall now with hyperglycemia, HTN, and pyuria. Initially 
admitted to the orthopedic service but transferred to medicine 
for further management. 
  
# Hyperglycemia/DM I: Pt w/ very high sugars in the setting of 
having her glargine held on admission (up to 500s), 
hospitalization, UTI. Lytes w/o e/o DKA. ___ consulted, 
recommended BID glargine and sliding scale (carb counting was 
stopped). Sugars trended down with this adjustment. As her 
insulin sensitivity improves she may require further 
down-titration in her glargine and ISS regimen. Would not 
restart carb-counting until she follows up with ___ (needs to 
be scheduled for within 1 week of discharge from rehab). 
Continue to follow sugars closely at least 4 times per day.  

# HyperK: Pt with Ks>5 throughout hospitalization, baseline ___. 
Down to 5.3 on the day of discharge after lasix. Most likely 
reflects a DM-related type IV RTA (TTKG 6, pos UAG). Does have 
CKD which likely contributes. Insulin resistanc may also have 
contributed. No e/o toxicity on EKGs. Please check her 
electrolytes/chemistries on ___, and every ___ days therafter 
if stable. Discharge K 5.3. While at rehab, can use prn ___ mg 
lasix PO for K>5.5 but would monitor volume status closely and 
use gentle IVF or encourage robust PO intake to compensate for 
associated diuresis. Discharged on a low K diet. Consider renal 
referral if continues to be elevated (also for CKD, see below).
 
# R clavicular fx: Comminuted, traumatic in the setting of fall. 
Per ortho OK to weight bear on it as tolerated, should use a 
sling, nonsurgical. Pain controlled with oxycodone intially but 
developed urinary retention requiring a foley, so methadone was 
increased TID w/ standing Tylenol (QTc's wnl). ___ evaluated and 
recommended rehab. She will have outpt ortho f/u. Her methadone 
should be titrated back to BID dosing as her pain improves. No 
e/o MM on recent lab work. Could consider renal osteodystrophy 
as a contributor (would recommend renal f/u as outpt as below)

# Frequent falls: She has fallen multiple times in the setting 
of s/p BKA with prosthesis on the R, autonomic/peripheral 
neuropathy. She should be given training on strategies to 
prevent falling in the future, and may benefit from a home 
safety eval. Discharged to rehab with walker/prosthesis as 
before.

# UTI: History of Ecoli UTIs ___ to cipro/CTX. Pyuria here, 
urine contaminated. No systemic symptoms or fevers to suggest 
higher grade infxn. No CVA tenderness. Treated initially with 
CTX/cefpodox and transitioned to PO cipro for a 7 day course for 
a complicated UTI.

# Anemia: Discharge hct 22. Hct has been approximately this low 
for the past ___ months. Normocytic. Iron studies c/w chronic 
disease (though home iron was continued). Also has CKD, could be 
contributing. No e/o blood loss or hemolysis.  SPEP negative in 
___. Retic inappropriately low, suggestive of chronic 
inflammation of bone marrow. If continues to be anemic as outpt, 
consider the following heme w/u: EPO level, peripheral smear, 
hematology/nephrology referral. Would transfuse for hct<21. 
 
# ___: Resolved. Baseline Cr 1.4, peaked at 1.8, back to 
baseline with IVF. Pre-renal picture by BUN/Cr, most likely ___ 
osmotic diuresis from very high sugars. s/p IVF, resolved. 
Urinating well, no obstruction. Outpatient followup with 
nephrology recommended (e.g. for EPO, bone disease monitoring 
etc).  

# HTN: BPs have been 130s-170s here. Recent med history notable 
for attempts to titrate off clonidine, holding of lisinopril ___ 
hyperkalemia, and increase in her labetalol dose here back to 
600 BID from 300. Increased her amlodipine to 10 mg and d/c'd 
clonidine. BP with better control on this regimen. As an 
outpatient, given CKD and DM, consider restarting her lisinopril 
if felt that she will tolerate this (but hyperkalemia will 
likely limit this).

# Rales on exam: Pt not dyspneic or hypoxic. No edema on CXR on 
admission. Nml TTE 2 months ago. It was felt that she was 
splinting bc of pain from her fx. She was given IS, as well as 
home tiotropium and albuterol (for COPD).
 
# Intermittent confusion at home: Pt notes episodes of 
intermittent confusion at home, associated with disorientation. 
A+0 x3 here. She did have some microvascular dx on CT head, 
which could argue for vascular dementia. She has known thyroid 
disease on replacement. Consider outpt neuropsych eval. 

# S/p R BKA: Recently had an infected blister at that site but 
looked well-healed on exam. Continued home Plavix. Continued 
home Gabapentin 300 mg PO/NG TID. 

# GI: Has h/o DM gastroparesis. Continued home Reglan, PPI, w/ 
zofran prn.

# Home meds:
- Continued citalopram
- COntinued calcitriol
- COntinue home fexofenadine
- Continue home folic acid
- Continue home iron
- Cont home simvastatin

Transition issues:
- Ortho f/u
- TID methadone dosing should be titrated back to BID as pain 
improves
- ___ followup needs to be scheduled for within 1 week of 
discharge from rehab
- Insulin regimen adjusted by ___ for high sugars (no DKA), 
this may need to be further adjusted as she becomes more insulin 
responsive after recovering from her acute event.
- Previously carb-counted for meals, which was stopped given her 
labile sugars.  This can be restarted at ___ followup. 
Discharged on a sliding scale
- BP regimen adjusted 
- If tolerates, consider restarting lisinopril as outpatient 
given benefit for DM-nephropathy (but hyperkalemia may limit 
this) 
- Needs teaching on fall prevention, consider home safety eval
- For hyperkalemia, please check her electrolytes/chemistries on 
___, and every ___ days therafter if stable. Discharge K 5.3. 

- Can use prn ___ mg lasix PO for K>5.5 but would monitor 
volume status closely and use gentle IVF or encourage robust PO 
intake to compensate for associated diuresis
- Discharge hct 22: Hct's stable over last 2 months. Would check 
hct on ___ times per week to monitor for stability. Transfuse 
for hct<21 (can be done at outpatient transfusion center)
- Pending B12/folate need to be followed up
- Consider the following outpt anemia workup: EPO level, 
peripheral smear, hematology referral 
- Outpatient followup with nephrology recommended (e.g. for EPO, 
bone disease monitoring etc).

IMAGING
=======
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND (___)
IMPRESSION: Limited imaging of the abdomen demonstrate cirrhotic 
liver, small volume
ascites, and small right pleural effusion.

ABDOMINAL X-RAY (___)
IMPRESSION: Dilated colon which is filled with a significant 
amount of air and stool.  No
small-bowel obstruction.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___) 
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with h/o cirrhosis d/t autoimmune hepatitis, 
DM1, CKD, and multiple admissions for recurrent UTI admitted for 
AMS thought to be secondary to long-acting narcotics potentiated 
by poor oral intake and subsequent ___.

#) Delirium, hypoactive: suspect AMS was primarily due to 
methadone overdose in the setting ___ and impaired narcotic 
clearance.  Picture was likely multifactorial; that is, 
complicated by multiple electrolyte abnormalities, hepatic 
encephalopathy, and constipation.  Patient was initially treated 
with empiric Zosyn for possible UTI, but this was ultimately 
discontinued, as sepsis investigations were unrevealing. Patient 
had a small amount of ascites, but her exam remained 
inconsistent with SBP.  Head CT did not demonstrated acute 
intracranial pathology. She returned to baseline mental status 
by discharge.

#) ___ on CKD: Cr 3.4 upon admission (baseline 1.4-1.8). Injury 
was thought to be pre-renal in nature, given suboptimal oral 
intake. Urine output and creatinine improved with fluids, albeit 
slowly, suggesting concomitant ATN or intra-renal injury. 
Further investigation was deemed inconsistent with new goals of 
care.

#) Constipation, opioid-induced: KUB demonstrated significant 
amount of stool upon admission. Home lactulose was titrated to 
___ bowel movements per day. Resolution seemingly paralleled 
return to baseline mentation.

#) DM1: patient had one asymptomatic episode of ___ ___ due to 
poor oral intake and insulin stacking in the setting of ___. 
Home insulin glargine and ISS were accordingly adjusted. Home 
basal regimen was cautiously reintroduced.

#) Hypercalcemia: improved with fluids and restoration of kidney 
function. Probably due to immobility. PTH appropriately low. CXR 
not suggestive of tumor and consequent hypercalcemia of 
malignancy. No protein gap. Further investigation for multiple 
myeloma was deemed inconsistent with new goals of care.

#) Hyponatremia: improved with judicious fluids, suggesting 
hypovolemic hyponatremia. Probable component of poor solute 
intake too. Urine studies equivocal. 

#) Hyperkalemia: minor; no ECG changes. Due to ___. Improved 
with fluids and restoration of kidney function.

#) HTN: intermittently hypertensive to sBP 170; asymptomatic. 
Home carvedilol was increased to 12.5 QAM, 12.5 QPM with 
adequate effect. Home clonidine, amlodipine, hydralazine, Imdur 
were continued. Home lisinopril was held in the setting of ___.

#) Goals of care: after discussion with patient (when coherent), 
husband (proxy), palliative care, and SW, it was determined that 
frequent re-admissions and generalized aversion to 
hospitalization do not align with her preferences. She 
ultimately prefers to remain at home with adequate analgesia for 
her chronic left leg/lumbar back pain. Code status amended to 
DNR/DNI.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
#) Back pain/left leg pain: patient previously on methadone 5 mg 
TID, which was  discontinued by PCP for long QT. It was learned 
that patient subsequently obtained methadone via sharing at 
home. Palliative care recommended low-dose opioid as needed for 
pain management. Patient did not have evidence of opioid 
withdrawal.

#) Normocytic, normochromic anemia: suspect patient arrived 
hemoconcentrated from poor oral intake. Subsequent decline was 
thus due to hemodilution after volume expansion.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo female with T1DM (insulin pump), chronic lumbar disk 
disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe peripheral 
vascular disease s/p right BKA (___), orthostatic hypotension 
(on salt tabs) who had been admitted on ___ for 
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea in the setting of running out of 
opioids, was found to be hypertensive and had altered mental 
status, and mild DKA, so she was transferred to the MICU for 
?hypertensive emergency. Her blood pressures improved and 
confusion resolved.
.
# Hypertensive urgency: Patient has a history of hypertension, 
but because of orthostatic hypotension she takes salt tabs and 
is not on any home antihypertensives. In the ED, Ms. ___ had 
BP 219/95 P 62. She received 2L NS, morphine 5mg, and IV hydral 
20 mg. Head CT was negative for edema. On the floor, she 
received IV hydral 10mg x1 and labetalol, but her SBPs only 
temporarily dropped below 200. She was transferred to the MICU, 
where she was started on labetalol gtt and transitioned to PO 
labetalol. Her BPs remained elevated (SBPs 160s-180s), but PCP 
recommended goal ~160 given orthostatic hypotension. She was 
transferred to the floor, where because of relatively low BPs 
120s-140s her labetalol was weaned and she was transitioned to 
lisinopril 5mg and then lisinopril 2.5mg. She was discharged on 
lisinopril 2.5 mg. In the AM, prior to getting her medications 
her BP was as high as 180, but throughout the rest of the day 
her SBPs were 120s-140s. She underwent a renal artery ultrasound 
that showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis. Serum 
metanephrines and 24-hr urine metanephrines were collected and 
pending at the time of discharge.
.
# Orthostatic hypotension: Patient with known orthostatic 
hypotension, which is why she has not been on antihypertensives 
at home. In MICU SBPs 160->120. Improved on the floor, but still 
positive on lisinopril 2.5 mg at the time of discharge although 
asymptomatic (SBP 151->129). Likely a component of autonomic 
dysfunction due to diabetes.
.
# Altered mental status: In the ED, the patient was 
intermittently confused. Her insulin pump was removed, she 
received morphine 10mg and ativan 2mg IV. Her serum and urine 
tox screens were negative, except for opioids. On arrival to the 
floor, she was somnolent but arousable and interactive, but 
minimally conversational and orientation could not be assessed. 
In the MICU, she returned to her baseline mental status (A&Ox3, 
conversational) and remained there for the remainder of this 
admission. Head CT revealed no hemorrhage, edema, or midline 
shift. She was afebrile and had negative Bcx x2. EKG showed 
RBBB, but no ST-changes and cardiac enzymes were negative x3. 
The mental status changes were likely contributed to by opioid 
intoxication, mild DKA, and possibly severe hypertension.
.
# Respiratory alkalosis: On arrival to the floor, the patient 
had a respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.51, pCO2 22). She was 
somnolent, but arousable. This was resolved by four hours later 
and likely was due to opioid intoxication.
.
# DKA: Patients insulin pump was removed in the ED and by the 
time she was on the floor she had an anion-gap metabolic 
acidosis (HCO3 18, anion gap 18). Overall blood was alkalemic 
due to a primary respiratory alkalosis. She received insulin 6 
units, insulin 10 units, and was put on an insulin drip. ___ 
was consulted. The anion gap was corrected by HD3. She was 
switched over to sliding scale and then restarted on her home 
insulin pump and regimen. At the time of discharge, her BSGs 
were stable ranging between 130s and 190s (mostly 140s). She was 
r/o for an MI and there were no signs of infection. 
.
# EKG changes: Initial EKGs revealed a new RBBB. Cardiology was 
consulted and thought likely to be rate related. TTE revealed 
hyperdynamics with no wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes 
were negative x3. The RBBB was resolved on HD2.
.
# ___: Likely pre-renal. On the floor, creatinine bumped to 1.4 
(from 1.0). She received 1L NS bolus and her urinary output 
increased and creatinine was downtrending (1.1 on discharge). 
.
# Chronic pain: Patient has baseline phantom pain in right leg 
(s/p BKA). Extremities were warm and well perfused with 
dopplerable pulses. Pain was reasonably controlled on home 
gabapentin, MScontin BID, and oxycodone ___ daily PRN.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Patient was initially on IV levothyroxine when 
unable to tolerate PO's, then transitioned back to home dose.  
.
# PVD: Continued on home plavix, zocor while able to take PO.

# Depression: Patient without complaints during this admission. 
Continued on home meds.
.
# s/p right BKA: Worked with ___, who recommended ambulation TID 
and outpatient ___.
.
# TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- ___ for BP checks.
- Continue biweekly ___
- Started lisinopril 2.5 mg PO
- Stopped salt tabs
- Should follow-up with PCP regarding antihypertensive regimen.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___. When you 
first arrived you were confused and your blood pressure was very 
high. We controlled your blood pressure with medications and 
started you on a new medication lisinopril. Given your history 
of low blood pressure, you should be careful when getting up 
quickly and discuss this medication with Dr. ___. Your confusion 
improved when your blood pressures decreased.

Prior to your arrival you reported some vomiting and diarrhea. 
We helped hydrate you with intravenous fluids. Your vomiting and 
diarrhea resolved and we were able to stop the intravenous 
fluids.

Because of your confusion, we had removed your insulin pump. As 
you improved we resumed your home insulin pump with corrections 
and evening lantus, as you did prior to your hospitalization.

During your hospitalization, you were seen by physical therapy. 
They recommended continuing outpatient physical therapy.  You 
will be visited by nurse to help check your blood pressures.

The following changes were made to your medications:

with hospital course complicated by ___, DKA, and hypertensive 
emergency, admitted to medicine s/p fall with  ___, and urinary 
retention. 

ACUTE ISSUES

# ___ 
Mrs. ___ urinary retention was most likely ___ recent 
narcotic use after being discharged from rehab. The pt was not 
taking morphine in rehab and was discharged a few days prior to 
admission. Since discharge, she has endorsed using morphine and 
oxycodone. She has had recent admissions with sedation assoc. 
with narcotic use, urinary retention and ___. Her calculated  
FeNa/FeUrea both suggested a component of pre-renal/dehydration 
which is supported by patient history (decreased po's for last 
few days). CHF was less likely given that most recent echo ___ 
showed EF>70%. Obstructive process also possible however renal 
U/S on ___ showed no nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, or renal 
mass. Pyelonephritis also possible however pt was afebrile and 
did not endorse any CVA tenderness on exam. A foley catheter was 
placed and her creatinine rapidly improved. Narcotics were also 
avoided in the management of Mrs. ___ chronic pain. She was 
closely monitored for the development of post-obstruction 
diuresis. Mrs. ___ remained clinically stable, and on day of 
discharge, her Cr. had downtrended to 1.3 from 3.7 on admission. 


# Type 1 Diabetes
Pt has T1D complicated by PVD, s/p right BKA. ___ was 
consulted to assist in her insulin regimen. She had one episode 
of hypoglycemia to 28. However her blood sugars stabilized with 
an adjusted insulin regimen and she remained clinically stable.  


# s/p Fall
Pt suffered mechanical fall ___, falling on left hip, no 
LOC, no head strike. Imaging of LLE and Head CT were negative 
for acute process or fx. Her pain s/p fall was managed with her 
home methadone regimen, standing tylenol, and lidocaine patches. 
Given her ___, NSAIDs were avoided for pain management, as well 
as oxycodone and morphine given the potential for urinary 
retention. Physical Therapy was consulted to evaluate the 
patient and it was determined that she was safe to return home. 

# Leukocytosis: 
Pt presents with leukocytosis to 15. Most likely reactive s/p 
fall onto left hip. No other signs of infection. Pt was afebrile 
with all other vital signs wnl. CXR showed no signs of 
consolidation, and UA was negative. On day of discharge, her 
leukocytosis had resolved and she was clinically stable. 

# Hyponatremia 
Patient presented with mildly decreased sodium to 128, new since 
last admission. Thought to be secondary to volume depletion 
given concurrent hypochloremia, history, and evidence of 
pre-renal azotemia. ___ have been exacerbated by 
post-obstruction diuresis with inability to retain Na. ___ also 
have been mixed picture though as specific gravity not 
especially concentrated. The patient received hydration with NS 
and her hyponatremia resolved. 

#Acidemia 
The patient presented with a mild metabolic acidosis based on 
low bicarb and gap (=16). No evidence of infection. Glucose 
mildly elevated but no ketones in urine. Most likely secondary 
to azotemia. Her bicarb and anion gap were monitored and had 
normalized by day of discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

# Chronic Pain
Pt has chronic pain assoc. with phantom limb pain s/p right BKA 
as well as neuropathy, chronic back and shoulder pain. Also 
concerns regarding narcotic over-use given multiple admissions 
for sedation in the setting of narcotics. The patient's 
gabapentin was increased from her home dose, and her chronic 
pain was managed with her home regimen of methadone and tylenol. 
NSAIDs were avoided given the patient's ___. 

# Elevated alk phos
Alk Phos elevated to 100s on admission. This may have been ___ 
recent fall. The pt's alk phos has been elevated in past, all 
other LFTs were wnl. She has no known hx of malignancy. A GGT 
level was also elevated at 85. Recommend further out-patient 
evaluation. 

#Hypothyroidism
The patient has a known diagnosis of hypothyroidism and was 
continued on her home regimen of levothyroxine. 

# Depression
The patient has a known diagnosis of depression and remained 
clinically stable on her home regimen of Celexa. 
 
**TRANSITIONAL ISSUE
-Please consider an out-patient evaluation for the patient's 
elevated alkaline phosphatase and GGT.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___:

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___ 
___. As you know, you were admitted after 
falling, and your kidney function was found to be decreased. 
This is likely due to the pain medications you were taking 
(morphine and oxycodone) which can cause urinary retention, and 
decreased kidney function.

We managed your pain with methadone and tylenol, and placed a 
foley catheter. The foley catheter removed a significant amount 
of urine, and your kidney function improved. 

Please avoid pain medications such as oxycodone and morphine to 
prevent further urinary retention and to protect your kidneys. 
You had an episode of low blood sugar during this admission, and 
your insulin was adjusted without further incident of low blood

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a h/o DMT1, 
gastroparesis, peripheral neuropathy, CAD, R BKA, PAD, 
hypothyroidism, and depression who presents with hyperglycemia 
and several weeks of left toe pain consistent with cellulitis 
with radiographic findings (both plain film and MRI) concerning 
for osteomyelitis. She was started on broad spectrum IV 
antibiotics. Podiatry was consulted but deferred any surgical 
intervention. The possibility of ___ guided bone biopsy to obtain 
microbiology data was discussed, but as she had already been on 
antibiotics for nearly two weeks, it was felt that this would 
likely be low yield. She will complete a 6 week course of 
Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone (end date ___. Her hospital 
course was also complicated by hypertension as high as 210 
systolic, which was exacerbated by not being able to tolerate PO 
medications due to nausea. Her hypertension was managed with IV 
Hydralazine when necessary and her BP meds were changed as 
stated in transitional issues below. Her nausea and vomiting 
were managed with fluids, Lorazepam, Metaclopromide, and 
Ondansetron (thought to be from her gastroparesis). She also 
developed urinary retention that is thought to be due to 
complications for her diabetes and immobility and she required 
intermittent straight caths and will go home with a foley. She 
has a hyponatremia that was likely a mixed ___ that 
remained stable at ~130s upon discharge. She had poor PO during 
her hospital stay and ___ was consulted for her diabetes and 
her insulin was adjusted (see below). ___ recommended rehab, but 
she has no rehab days left on her insurance.

#L toe cellulitis/osteomyelitis
#Peripheral vascular disease
#L ___ metatarsal fractures: 
Diagnosed via Xray/MRI. s/p angiogram with stent placement ___ 
to improve distal flow. On IV Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone planned 6 
week course. ID followed. Pain controlled with standing Tylenol, 
with PRN tramadol

#Diabetes mellitus, type 1
#Gastroparesis:
N/V/gastroparesis flare during her hospital stay. Her 
gastroparesis was managed with IV Ativan, IV Reglan, IV Zofran, 
and IV fluids. Also had persistent labile blood sugars, 
intermittent asymptomatic hypoglycemia. ___ following with 
daily insulin regimen titration. ___ was consulted and 
titrated her insulin down to lantus 4 U qam, lantus 8 U qpm, and 
Humalog 2+1 for every 50 mg/dL starting at 150 at meals and 1+1 
for every 50 mg/dL starting at 200 at bedtime 

#Hypertensive urgency:  
She has persistently high BP in the morning (SBP ~170s) and had 
a SBP of 210 at one point (in setting of nausea/vomiting from 
gastroparesis flare). Her gastroparesis was managed and she was 
started on lisinopril 20 mg qd. Her home clonidine was decreased 
to 0.2mg BID and she was continued on her home amlodipine 10 mg 
PO/NG DAILY and hydralazine 100 mg PO/NG Q8H. Her isosorbide 
dinitrate was switched to imdur 90 mg qd. Her Lasix and 
spironolactone were held in the setting of poor PO intake. 

#Chronic kidney disease: 
#Urinary retention:
Cr near baseline, 1.7-1.8 in setting of CKD. Likely underlying 
urge incontinence with retention from diabetic induced urinary 
neuropathy, requiring intermittent straight cath for retention. 
FeNA 1.3% on ___. Concern for chronic diabetic nephropathy as 
well. She will go home with a foley. 

#Hyponatremia: 
Likely mixed ___ picture. Downtrended to ~130s and 
remained stable. FeNA 1.3% ___.

#Asymptomatic bacteruria: 
Patient had large leukocytes on U/A and >182 on microscopy but 
not symptomatic (no dysuria, increased frequency). Normally 
would not treat, but she was already on broad-spectrum abx for 
cellulitis/presumed osteomyelitis. 

#Respiratory alkalosis: 
VBG on admission notable for pH 7.55 and pCO2 of 23 with unclear 
etiology given lack of signs of hypoxia leading to 
hyperventilation (no tachypnea, no clinical signs of pneumonia, 
pulmonary edema, or PE). Could be attributed to L toe pain. 
Repeat VBG showing pH of 7.41 and pCO2 normalized. 

#Hypercalcemia: 
Unclear etiology, resolved on HD2. She denies symptoms such as 
abdominal pain, constipation, and does not appear to have 
altered mental status. PTH, Vitamin D were checked and were 
normal. Her calcium subsequently normalized.

#Anemia: chronic, stable, likely due to chronic disease 
#Chronic Pain: Continued home methadone 5 mg TID, Tylenol, 
lidocaine. 
#CAD: Continued home ASA 81, Plavix.  
#HLD: Continued home rosuvastatin 10mg qHS  
#Depression: Continued home citalopram 20mg daily.  
#Hypothyroidism: Continued levothyroxine 88 mcg PO QD.  
#GERD:  Continued home Pantoprazole 40mg daily  
#COPD: Continued albuterol inhaler 2 PUFF IH Q6H:PRN wheeze, 
continued home advair and spiriva.
#Glaucoma: Continued brimonidine-timolol 0.2-0.5 % ophthalmic 
BID, and artificial tears.
#Constipation: Senna, Colace, milk of magnesia, miralax.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ ___ with history of Child's Class B cirrhosis thought 
secondary to autoimmune hepatitis decompensated by mild 
encephalopathy and possible upper GI bleed (MELD 24 on 
admission), type I diabetes complicated by gastoparesis, and 
multiple recent hospitalizations for UTI who presents with 
fatigue, poor PO intake, and positive urine culture. 

ACTIVE ISSUES 
==============
#CAUTI: Given chronic Foley, decision was made to treat for 
complicated UTI for 7 days with ciprofloxacin. Her Foley was 
changed on ___. She will follow up with uro/gyn on ___ 
for this. Enterobacter cloacae growing in urine cultures from 
___ and ___ that is sensitive to Cipro. Transitioned to 
PO Cipro on ___. Patient was hemodynamically stable 
throughout the hospitalization with somnolence at times, but 
alert and oriented x 3 at discharge. 

#NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA/?UGIB: H/H 6.6/20.3 on admission, compared to 
7.5/23.9 on ___. Stool was guiaic negative in ED. Initial 
concern for possible GI bleeding given her history of cirrhosis, 
but the patient and family declined EGD in favor of going back 
home with hospice services. The patient received two units of 
pRBC. The phlebotomy team was unable to draw labs, and 
eventually the patient declined labs as well, which we honored. 
She did have a bowel movement with no signs of bleeding on ___. 
She will be discharged home with home services (not quite 
hospice level services) understanding the risks of not getting 
an EGD to screen for possible bleeding source. She was otherwise 
stable on discharge.

#DM1: Hypoglycemic to 33 on ___ AM and 23 on ___ AM. 
___ was after receiving home lantus 6 untis the night prior. 
Nighttime lantus was decreased to 4 units that night but she 
again developed hypoglycemia to 23 the next morning. She was 
also receiving home lantus 2 units in the morning each day. Both 
episodes resolved with po intake. She declined IV placement for 
dextrose. ___ was consulted prior to discharge and 
recommended: Lantus 4 units in the AM, SSI starting at 2 units 
and increasing by 1 for every 50 above 150. 

# CKD: Cr 3.0 on admission, which appears stable as compared to 
her creatinine at the time of her last discharge.

#AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS: with recent ultrasound findings 
consistent with cirrhosis with liver biopsy in ___. Reports in 
electronic health record that patient was previously treated 
with steroids. There was a discussion about need for EGD as 
above, but patient and family declined in favor of quality of 
life measures and returning home with hospice.

#Hypertension: Occasionally elevated in the hospital. She was 
restarted on her home carvedilol, clonidine, amlodipine, 
hydralazine, and Imdur, but lisinopril was held in setting of 
creatinine now stable at 3.0. Blood pressure responded well to 
home BP meds. She was discharged on her home regimen. 

#GOALS OF CARE: During previous admission, from discussion with 
patient, husband (proxy), palliative care, and SW, it was 
determined that frequent re-admissions do not align with her 
preferences and generalized aversion to hospitalization. She 
ultimately prefers to remain at home with adequate analgesia for 
her chronic left leg/lumbar back pain. Based on conversation on 
___ in conjunction with husband, son, and PACT RN ___ 
___, patient desires to be at home with better quality of 
life. Family understands that they can, in conversation with Dr. 
___, decide to bring her into the hospital if she is ill, but no 
further interventions will be done at this time given that ___ 
is declining any more aggressive measures. She will go home with 
previous home services, which are not quite hospice level, with 
plan to maximize comfort. 

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: 
=========================
#BACK PAIN/LEFT LEG PAIN: Continue Oxycodone 5 mg Q8H PRN 

Code: DNR/DNI. MOLST currently states "Do not hospitalize", but 
husband decided to bring her in this time and will likely still 
bring her in in the future if there are urgent needs.
Contact: Son ___ ___ 

___ Issues:
==========================
[] Administer cipro as prescribed through ___, then restart 
Nitrofurantoin suppressive therapy.
[] If patient experiences confusion, weakness, consider checking 
UA/UCx and re-treating for UTI.
[] If any signs of bleeding, contact Dr. ___. 
Patient will decide at that time if she desires re-admission.
[] OK to give an extra dose of 5 mg oxycodone if in pain as long 
as patient not somnolent
[] patient's finger stick glucose dipped into the 20's-30's each 
morning while in the hospital. Reduced insulin to 4 units 
glargine in the morning plus mealtime-only gentle sliding scale. 
Please monitor finger sticks 4 times per day and contact Dr. ___ 
with any issues.

autonomic dysfunction), hypertension w/recurrent HTN urgency, 
w/recent ICU admission ___ for E coli urosepsis, who 
presents for nausea and vomitting and Hypertensive urgency.  

She was brought in by ambulance for not being able to keep 
anything down since last night and had vomiting x 4 with no 
blood. He also had elevated blood sugars to the 400s.  Patient 
has a nurse at home and has reportedly been compliant with 
insulin. Of note, she has had multiple episodes of DKA in the 
past. No urinary symptoms, fevers, chest pain, SOB, abdominal 
pain but has AMS which was concerning to her nurse. 

On arrival to the ED by ambulance, the patient was tachycardic 
and appears uncomfortable. She has coarse breath sounds

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ with history of DVT, CAD/MI, T1DM (c/b 
gastroparesis, R BKA, neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction), and 
HTN who initially presented for nausea, vomiting, concern for 
sepsis and hypertensive urgency ultimately not found to have 
infectious source with course complicated by hyponatremia.  

#Sepsis:
#Leukocytosis: supported by elevated WBC, tachycardia, and 
grossly positive UA. The patient has history of severe urosepsis 
requiring ICU admissions. Her CXR is negative however, her CT 
showed ill-defined opacities at the lung bases bilaterally, 
likely due to chronic aspiration. The patient does not have sign 
of meningitis, her CT abdomen excluded intra-abdominal 
collection. She was given Tylenol for fever. She was initially 
on vanc/zosyn but this was transitioned to ceftriaxone after 
marked improvement in her status. She did not require 
vasopressors. She was transferred to the floor in stable 
condition. Her urine and blood cultures did not yield source of 
infection. Though she initially had a slight increase in her 
white count this resolved without intervention. Ultimately, no 
clear source of infection was found, but the patient clinically 
improved with antibiotics.

#Hypertension urgency: 
The patient had recent episode of hypertensive urgency in 
___. Recent medication changes include isosorbide dinitrate, 
hydralazine and clonidine following ___. She has history of 
beta-blocker toxicity on labetalol. Her spironolactone was held 
in the setting of elevated K. The labetalol gtt was discontinued 
the morning after admission and she was restarted on her home 
hydrazine 100 mg TID PO, amlodipine 10 mg qd, and an increased 
dose of her imdur to 30 mg TID. On the floor, her blood pressure 
remained well controlled onher discharge regimen.

#AMS/encephalopathy: 
Likely toxic metabolic from sepsis. CT head was negative for 
acute stroke. The patient had significant history of AMS during 
her prior hospitalization with urosepsis. Her AMS is waxing and 
waining which is suggestive of delirium. She was A+Ox3 upon 
transfer to the floor. On the floor, her mental status remained 
stable without further evidence of delirium. 

#Nausea and vomiting:
#Hyperglycemia: 
#Anion gap metabolic acidosis:
Likely in the setting of sepsis and her N/V could be from flare 
of gastroparesis. She was given mIVF and given fluid boluses. 
She was given metoclopramide 5mg with meals qHS for nausea. Her 
gap closed after fluid resuscitation and she did not require 
insulin gtt. On the floor, she was evaluated by the ___ 
___. They made adjustments to her insuling regimen, since she 
did have episodes of hypoglycemia. On discharge, her blood 
sugars were well controlled on the discharge regimen.

#Hyponatremia
Her course was complicated by hyponatremia. This was thought to 
be hypovolemic in nature. It improved with fluids. On discharge, 
her Na was 131. A BMP should be repeated within the next 7 days, 
and her PCP can ___ on the results. 

___: Likely due to pre renal as it improved with IVF.

#Anemia: 
On admission, drop in Hgb from 9.2 to 7.2. ___ be ___ dilution 
given IVF given over course of stay.  She had no melena or BRB 
on rectal exam and hemolysis labs were wnl. She was transfused 1 
u PRBC prior to transfer to the floor. On the floor, her HCT 
remained stable without further need for transfusion

#NSTEMI II: Tn peak at 0.04 likely in the setting of CKD and 
hypovolemia. EKG was not concerning for ACS.

# Chronic Pain:  Originally held methadone and gabapentin as 
above for prior AMS.  Started on Tylenol 1 g q8h prn and 
lidocaine ointment. This was discussed with PCP and her 
methadone was restarted.

IMAGING/REPORTS
=======================

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
FINDINGS:  
There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, 
or pulmonary edema.  Allowing for technique, the 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process. 

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
FINDINGS:  
There is no evidence of infarction, hemorrhage, edema, or mass.  
Prominence of the ventricles and sulci suggest age related 
global atrophy.  Periventricular hypodensities are nonspecific, 
but likely reflect sequelae of chronic small vessel ischemic 
disease.  The basal cisterns appear patent and there is 
preservation of gray-white matter differentiation. No acute 
fracture is seen. The paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, and 
middle ear cavities are clear. Atherosclerotic calcifications of 
the carotid siphons are noted. 
  
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:  
___ with h/o DM1, CAD, PAD, HTN, and HLD admitted with AMS and 
hyperglycemia. 

# HHS: hx of T1DM but no ketones on UA. Unclear trigger - no e/o 
infection, and less likely noncompliance as pt appears unable to 
manage her insulin pump. +End organ damage with ___, troponin 
elevation, and AMS, which all resolved. ___ was consulted and 
determined that patient is no longer a candidate for her insulin 
pump.  She was transitioned to long acting insulin lantus and 
SSI per ___ recommendations

# Encephalopathy: Toxic/metabolic due to HHNKC.  Improved with 
treatment of HHS.  

# ARF: Baseline 1.4. Likely prerenal from HHS losses. Improved 
with IVF. 

# New RBB: troponins negative, EMS noted her to have a 
bradycardic episode however she maintained her blood pressure 
during this, strips were reviewed and consistent with sinus 
bradycardia.  Recommend she continue to see cardiology as an 
outpatient with possible event monitor should there be concern 
that her bradycardia is causing symptoms. 

Chronic issues:

# Anxiety/depression: continued citalopram

# CAD/PVD: Continued ASA, plavix, and atorvastatin

# HTN: continued home labetolol, hydralazine

# COPD: continued home spiriva and albuterol prn.

# Hypothyroidism: continued home levothyroxine.

# GERD: continued home pantoprazole.

except for increased urinary frequency for several days which is 
corroborated by outpatient notes. She had a urine culture 
several days prior to admission which grew mixed flora and she 
had not received antibiotics recently. 

She had a similary admission for AMS with bradycardia in ___ in the setting of hyperglycemia thought due to insulin pump 
noncompliance and she was detetrminted to be not able to manage 
her insulin pump and so was transitioned to lantus per ___ 
consult at that ___. 

She is sleepy during the interview but responding appropriately. 
She states her blood sugar this morning was 566 for which she 
took 22 units of sliding scale Humalog prior to coming to the 
ED. 

In th ED, she was given IV fluid and blood sugar was in the 
300-400s. 

Also per outpatient notes, her methadone dose was recently

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o woman with h/o of type I DM, CAD, CKD (baseline Cr 
1.3-2.0), PAD s/p R BKA, chronic back pain on methadone, 
statin-induced hepatitis admitted from ALF with encephalopathy 
found to have ___ and hyperglycemia.  Her course is summarized 
by problem below.

ACTIVE:

# Encephalopathy: Patient returned back to her baseline quite 
quickly after admission.  Infectious work-up was negative and 
labs were wnl, with the exception of the ___ on admission and 
the suspect-contaminated blood cultures (see below).  Unclear if 
___ methadone increase as this was done ~1 month ago.  
Alternatively pt reports that she takes Benadryl as needed for 
pruritus and the creams do not work.  Methadone was restarted at 
lower, 5mg TID dose, as was gabapentin given her dose seemed too 
high for her renal function.  She was advised to stop using 
benadryl.  PACT team followed allowed to help with home 
medication management.  Patient was discharged with ___ to 
help with medication management.

# Bactermia: Blood cultures from ___ grew out with GPCs in ___ 
bottles; and then again on ___, CoNS).  She appeared well 
clinically with no evidence of infection.  As a possible 
potential source, her right knee stump was x-rayed as she does 
have rods there - xray was negative for any evidence of osteo or 
SSTI.  CRP was less than 10.  She received vancomycin x 2 doses. 
ID was consulted and also agreed that both positive cultures 
were likely contaminated, but recommend the following:  
- IF ___ blood cultures grow out CoNS but with a different 
profile from ___, then it is a contaminant
- IF ___ blood cultures grow out a different species entirely 
from ___, then it is a contaminant
- IF ___ blood cultures grew out the SAME CoNS as in the ___ 
bottles, we need to reassess as possibly real
- PLEASE CHECK BLOOD CULTURES ON ___ APPOINTMENT

# HTN: Medications were titrated given ongoing SBPs in the 
190s-210s during her hospitalization.  Her hydralazine was 
increased, as was the frequency of her labetalol.  She still had 
elevated SBPs late night/early morning, but was asymptomatic, 
and during the day ran from 130s-150s systolic.  

#DM type 1: VBG in the ED 7.35/52/29 not consistent with 
significant with acidosis/DKA, despite hyperglycemia.  Possibly 
___ poor compliance as pt totally relies on her smart glucometer 
for insulin dosing and does not know her sliding scale regimen.  
___ was consulted and insulin regimen adjusted.  Patient was 
discharged home with ___ services and ___ f/u as outpatient 
upon discharge.

#Chronic back pain on methadone: restarted methadone 5mg PO TID 
as noted above, along with lower dose of gabapentin at 200 mg 
twice daily

#Acute renal failure on CKD: Improved with IVF, back to 
baseline.

#CAD: positive trop 0.03 on admission, likely demand related in 
context of dehydration.

vomiting, confusion, and worsening somnolence this morning - per 
her husband and son, the patient minimized most complaints but 
has had worsening fatigue over the past week. They say she has 
not reported any fevers or cough or urinary symptoms this week. 

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals notable for bradycardic to 
___ on arrival, febrile with BP, RR and oxygentation stable.

___ cxr
Slight improvement in right lower lung consolidation and minimal 
worsening of  right upper lobe consolidation. 

___ CXR 
Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is new right mid 
lung and progressing right lower lobe consolidations  concerning 
for aspiration pneumonia.  Left lung is essentially clear.  No  
evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No 
appreciable  pulmonary edema is seen. 
  Substantial degenerative changes in the right shoulder are 
present. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
1. Right lower lobe pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. 
2. Malpositioned endotracheal tube entering into right mainstem 
bronchus. 
3. Stable mild cardiomegaly. 

___ Imaging CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST 
There is no acute large territorial infarction, hemorrhage, 
edema or mass.  
Basal cisterns are patent is preservation of gray-white matter 
differentiation. Periventricular and subcortical white matter 
hypodensities are nonspecific, though likely sequelae of chronic 
small vessel ischemic disease. Prominent ventricles and sulci 
suggest age-related involutional changes. Punctate hypodensity 
in the left thalamus is stable, likely a chronic lacune. 
No fracture identified. There is scattered partial opacification 
of the 
anterior and posterior ethmoidal air cells. The remaining 
paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are 
clear. Visualized portions of the orbits are unremarkable. 

___ Imaging CHEST (PORTABLE AP) 
Endotracheal tube tip 1.4 cm above carina.  Improved pulmonary 
opacities, 
suggesting improving edema.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted with confusion.  You were found to have very 
low heart rates and pneumonia.  You initially required a 
breathing tube (intubation) and were admitted to the intensive 
care unit.  You were treated with antibiotics and your pneumonia 
improved.  Your home labetalol was stopped as it likely caused 
your low heart rates. 

Over the last week, you have had significant improvement in your 
recovery. However, you will benefit from a rehab stay to help 
keep you safe at home. We also started a steroid for your lung 
function but unfortunately this increased your sugars. We have 
since stopped the steroids. We are also concerned about 
aspiration while you are eating, and this may have led to your 
current pneumonia. Speech was consulted and evaluated you 

1. STOP Labetolol 
2. START clonidine 0.2 mg po two times a day
3. INCREASE Hydralazine to 25 mg po three times a day 
4. INCREASE Norvasc/amlodipine to 10 mg every day
5. START Advair 250/50 in addition to your tiotropium inhaler 
for your likely COPD

Discharge Labs:
Blood sugars ranged from 120s-230s. 
.
Microbiology: 
Blood Cultures (___): No growth.
.
Imaging/Studies:
# ECG (___): Sinus rhythm. Left axis deviation. Poor R wave 
progression, probably a normal variant. Compared to the previous 
tracing of ___ there is no significant interval diagnostic 
change. 
# CXR (___): IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
# CT Head without Contrast (___): IMPRESSION: No acute 
intracranial abnormality.  Stable hypodense foci in the right 
pons suggesting prior infarcts. 
# R shoulder X-ray (___): IMPRESSION: Old impaction deformity 
of the humeral head.  No acure fracture. 
# Renal US (___): IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound.
# ECG (___): Sinus rhythm. Some T-wave flattening in V5-V6 
which was new since the ECG on ___. However, the patient was 
not complaining of chest pain and her Troponin was <0.01, so the 
suspicion of MI was low. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ w/ type 1 diabetes mellitus (insulin pump), chronic lumbar 
disk disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, severe peripheral 
vascular disease with right BKA ___, chronic pain from PVD 
and phantom limb pain on narcotics), orthostatic hypotension 
(was on salt tabs) who presented after sliding off of her bed.  
.
Active Diagnoses:
.
#) COPD exacerbation: She complained of productive cough for 
about a week and increasing shortness of breath. Given her 
smoking history and the physical exam findings of decreased 
breath sounds with crackles at the lung bases, COPD exacerbation 
was the most likely diagnosis. Her CXR in the ER showed mild 
hyperinflation with no acute cardiopulmonary process. Congestive 
heart failure was less likely but she did complain of worsening 
short while laying flat, but this symptom had not acutely 
worsened over the past couple of days. Infectious causes were 
also considered but in the absence of fever, leukocytosis, and 
lack of CXR findings, this was less likely. She was given 
nebulizer treatments of albuterol and ipratropium and she was 
started on 5 day courses of prednisone and azythromycin. She 
began breathing better and stated that her auditory 
hallucinations had stopped. She completed her courses of 
prednisone and azithromycin while in the hospital. She was then 
discharged home with prescriptions for ProAir and Spiriva. She 
will follow up with her PCP ___ ___. She may get PFTs as an 
outpatient.    
. 
#) DM (Type I)/Steroid induced hyperglycemia: Ms. ___ 
sugars at home have ranged from 150-250. Her sugars were high on 
admission. She is followed by ___ who last adjusted her pump 
setting in ___. ___ was consulted on ___ to manage her 
sugars while she was receiving prednisone. ___ found that her 
insulin pump settings were off by 12hrs. Her pump had a bubble 
in the insulin cartridge, making it unclear how much insulin she 
had actually been receiving. Thus, ___ corrected her pump 
settings to account for steroids, replaced all pump materials 
and recommended a SQ insulin injection to help control her 
hyperglycemia. Her chemistries on ___ did not reveal an anion 
gap and there were no ketones in her urine. On ___, her BS 
remained high (300's) and she experienced a low of 48 in the 
morning. ___ further adjusted her settings. She continued to 
have blood sugars in the 300/400's on ___. She finished 
her course of prednisone on ___. On ___ her blood sugars 
ranged from ___ adjusted her pump to it's 
pre-admission settings and she was discharged home. She will 
follow up with ___ on ___.    
.
#) ___: Her creatinine on admission was 3.2, which was double 
the 1.6 observed on ___. With a FeNa of less than 1% in the 
context of recent poor po intake and decreased UOP, her ___ was 
most likely caused by hypovolemia. Her creatinine  improved with 
IVF. However, to better assess baseline kidney status, she had 
renal US on ___, which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, 
stones or suspicious masses. Her creatinine on ___ improved to 
1.4. Discharge labs were held secondary to increased difficulty 
with blood draws.  
.
# Phantom limb pain: Controlled at home with MS ___, 
gabapentin and oxycodone. Her MS ___ dose was decreased in 
the setting of ___. She reported a lot of phantom limb pain with 
the reduced dose, thus on ___ her MS ___ dose was increased. 
Her phantom limb pain then improved. 
.
#) Hypertension: She was hypertensive on admission but her home 
lisinopril was held in the setting of ___. She was started on

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o woman, pmh of T1D on insulin pump, PVD 
s/p right leg amputation, who presents s/p fall w/ head strike, 
as well as new visual and auditory hallucinations x 3 days. Pt 
recently seen by PCP ___ on ___ for left arm and torso 
pain after hitting her arm against the night stand in ___. 
Shoulder and humerus films were negative for fx and she was 
prescribed Naproxen for pain management. 

During this time, the patient developed acute urinary retention 
and was unable to urinate x 2 days. This AM, the patient stood 
up, began shaking, and attempted to use her walker which she 
uses at baseline, and then fell, hitting her head. EMS arrived 
on the scene, found her own, and brought her to ___ ED. 

In the ED initial vital signs: T 97.9 P 82 BP 138/59 R 16 O2Sat 
88% RA. Her physical exam in the ED was notable for being 
intermittently oriented x3, drowsy, and requiring prompting to 
answer questions. She also intermittently used vague hand 
motions and stated that she was knitting. Laboratory data in the 
ED was notable for urine tox positive for opiates (on chronic 
opioids w/ pain contract), negative serum tox, Na 125, K 5.4, 
BUN 54, Cr 4.6 (baseline 1.1) glucose 327, and lactate of 1.1. 
She had an anion gap of 18, however a UA was negative for 
ketones. She was started on IVF  and an insulin drip w/ bolus 
was started. A repeat glucose check was 46, her insulin drip was 
discontinued, and she was given an amp of dextrose. A head CT 
was negative for acute injury, and a CT C spine showed no fx. 
CXR was significant for possible mild congestion.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Pending): 

IMAGING/STUDIES:
EEG (___): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU 
monitoring study because of a
predominantly polymorphic delta pattern, indicative of a 
moderate to severe encephalopathy, which is etiologically 
nonspecific. There are no electrographic seizures or 
epileptiform discharges.

EEG (___): IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU 
monitoring study because of a low voltage, disorganized, and 
slow background, indicative of a moderate to severe 
encephalopathy, which is etiologically nonspecific. No definite 
epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures are seen.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST (___): IMPRESSION: 1.  No acute 
cervical spine fracture or prevertebral soft tissue swelling.   
2.  Moderate degenerative changes with mild central canal 
narrowing at multiple levels as described above.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST (___): FINDINGS: Again noted is a 
hypodensity in the pons suggestive of remote infarct as seen 
previously.  There is no evidence of an acute intracranial 
hemorrhage, edema, large vessel territorial infarction, or shift 
of the midline structures.  The ventricles and sulci are stably 
prominent in size and configuration, likely representing 
age-related cortical atrophic changes.  Bilateral 
periventricular and subcortical white matter hypodensities are 
again noted and likely sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic 
changes.  No acute fractures are identified.  The visualized 
mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are clear.  IMPRESSION: 
No acute intracranial injury.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: (___): FINDINGS:  There is no acute 
hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or large territorial infarction.  
Ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent with atrophy.  
The visualized paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle 
ear cavities are clear.  The bones are intact. IMPRESSION:  No 
acute intracranial process.

CXR (___): IMPRESSION: Possible mild congestion, otherwise 
no acute findings.

CXR (___): IMPRESSION:  Right basilar opacification is 
minimally increased since prior and may be still compatible with 
vascular congestion, considering prominent hila, although in the 
appropriate clinical setting pneumonia should be considered.

RENAL ULTRASOUND (___): IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis, 
nephrolithiasis or renal mass.

TTE (___): Conclusions: The left atrium and right atrium are 
normal in cavity size. The estimated right atrial pressure is at 
least 15 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>70%). The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler parameters are indeterminate for left 
ventricular diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. 
Mild mitral regurgitation. 

ECG (___): Normal sinus rhythm with delayed R wave 
transition. Cannot exclude prior anteroseptal myocardial 
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ there 
has been resolution of the inferior T wave inversion. Otherwise, 
no diagnostic change.

ECG (___): Sinus rhythm. Poor R wave progression. 
Non-specific lateral ST segment changes. Compared to tracing #1 
right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block are 
now present on the current tracing. These are likely due to 
rate-related bundle on the previous tracings.

ECG (___): Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. 
Possible anteroseptal wallmyocardial infarction, age 
indeterminate. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ a QS 
complex is now seen in lead V2 which may be due to lead 
placement. The Q-T interval is now prolonged.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman, pmh of T1DM, PVD s/p right 
leg amputation, seizures, who presented s/p fall with ___, 
hyperglycemia, and AMS.

# AMS: Initial altered mental status thought to be due to build 
up of opiate metabolites in setting of renal failure with 
componenent of toxic/metabolic encephalopathy. No evidence of 
seizures on EEG. Narcotics and other deliriogenic meds were held 
on admission. Patient's altered mental status improved with 
narcan and improvement in creatinine and patient was transferred 
to the floor. On ___, patient had recurrent altered mental 
status in the setting of hypertension to SBP of 240s and 
evidence of UTI on UA and urine culture. Patient was treated for 
UTI with ceftriaxone and hypertension was controlled with 
labetalol drip with subsequent improvement in mental status.  
Patient underwent repeat EEG which was negative for epileptiform 
activity, but did show diffuse slow waves consistent with 
encephalopathy of unclear etiology.  Labetalol drip was 
discontinued, patient was transitioned to PO anti-hypertensives 
(labetalol, amlodipine, lisinopril).  On discharge patient was 
alert and oriented x3.

#Hypertensive Emergency: Transferred back to the ICU on ___ 
with hypertension and AMS. Hypertension initially controlled 
with IV meds and then patient transitioned to labetalol gtt. 
Unclear etiology of hypertension but concern initially that 
patient was withdrawing from opiates with return of renal 
function. Patient tried on low dose opiates on ___ without 
significant improvement in hypertension. Hypertension ultimately 
controlled with PO labetolol 600 mg TID, amlopidine 10mg per day 
and lisinopril 20 mg per day.  Patient still intermittently has 
elevated blood pressures, however without mental status changes. 
 Recommend continued titration of anti-hypertensives as 
indicated. 
 
#Elevated troponins: Troponins elevated on admission with 
elevated CK-Mb which was disproportionate to Tn rise thought 
maybe related to skeletal muscle breakdown. Troponin leak 
thought to be related to mild demand ischemia in the setting of 
renal failure. Troponins trended down without further 
intervention. Of note, patient went into RBBB on EKG following 
narcan thought to be rate dependent RBBB as patient has had this 
in the past. Back into sinus rhythm once narcan wore off and 
tachycardia resolved. Echo performed ___ showed mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional 
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation 
without hypokinesis. 
 
# ___: Pt w/ Cr elevation to 4.6 from baseline of 1.1. ___ may 
be ___ poor PO intake and dehydration with hyperglycemia coupled 
with kidney injury in the setting of NSAID and lisinopril use. 
Renal consulted and spun urine which revealed ATN. Kidney 
function improved with IV fluids.  By discharge date (___), 
creatinine had retuned to baseline level of 1.1.  UOP was 
difficult to assess given patient was incontinent, however, per 
report, patient was making good urine.  Lisinopril was restarted 
in setting of improved renal function. 
 
# Hyperglycemia/T1DM: On insulin pump at home, followed by 
___, most recent A1C 7.4 in ___. Likely the patient 
stopped administering her insulin when she became confused at 
home. Her hyperglycemia likely caused osmotic diuresis and 
volume depletion thus causing further confusion. Patient 
initially on insulin gtt which was stopped on initial transfer 
to ICU. On return to ICU on ___, patient with mild

III, neuropathy/R BKA, autonomic dysfunction, htn who presents 
with altered mental status in setting of hypoglycemia and 
sepsis.  

#Sepsis/Polymicrobial Infection: In the MICU, patient was 
initially treated with ceftazidime and vanc was added when 
patient continued to spike fevers. Patient was extubated on ___ 
and speech and swallow was ordered due to concern for 
aspiration. In terms of infection, patient was initially thought 
to have urosepsis due to positive UA which eventually grew MDR, 
ESBL E. Coli. BCx from ___ grew pan-S Proteus, E.faecalis of 
two different morphologies and clostridium perfringens. BCx from 
___ and ___ have been NGTD. Sputum with E. coli as well. ID 
was consulted. She was initially treated with meropenem and 
vancomcyin and eventually narrowed to zosyn monotherapy with 
plans for two week course (___). PICC line was placed for 
abx administration. TTE was negative for vegetations. 

# DM1 c/b hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia: Was hypoglycemic at home. 
Started on D5W in MICU. She then became hyperglycemic with FSGs 
400-500s. ___ was consulted for help with diabetes 
management. She was ultimately placed on on Lantus 30AM and ___ 
Lantus 7 units qhs. She was also on ___. She did continued to 
have labile blood sugars based on her the adequacy of her PO 
intake, which was limited by her dislike for the modified diet 
(pureed and ground solids). Her FSGs should be monitored 
closely.

# HTN/Hypertensive Urgency: After her stay in the ICU, the 
patient had SBPs 180-190s on arrival to the floor. Patient 
otherwise asymptomatic (no chest pain, dyspnea, headaches, or 
visual changes. She History of beta-blocker toxicity on 
labetolol and also with RBBB and LAFB on ECG limited beta 
blockade. Instead, clonidine and hydralazine were increased. She 
was also started on spironolactone and isosorbide. She was 
continued on amlodipine as well. 

#Altered mental status: Significantly improved with glucose and 
sepsis control. Ddx included hypoglycemia, narcotic overdose (on 
methadone), Utox positive for amphetamine and methadone, toxic 
metabolic encephalopathy in setting of infection. Patient denied 
any use of amphetamines. Methadone and gabapentin were held 
during hospitalization. These can be started cautiously as 
outpatient.  

#Acute on chronic kidney disease stage IV. Likely pre-renal in 
setting of infection. Creatinine improved after aggressive 
rehydration in MICU. Baseline Cr 1.6-2.5. Resolved.

#Acute on chronic anemia: baseline Hgb appears to be in 7s. 
Likely due to CKD per prior DC summary and plan was to start Epo 
soon. Required transfusion during prior admission. Low suspicion 
for active bleed. Over the course of her hospital stay, her H/H 
downtrended toHgb 6.8 for which she received 1u PRBC on ___ 
with appropriate increase in Hgb the next day. 

RESOLVED:
#Acute respiratory failure s/p intubation. In setting of severe 
hypoglycemia and narcotics. AMS has significantly improved.  
Extubated on ___.

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
# CAD: Continued home ASA 81, Plavix.

# Gastroparesis: Continued home metoclopramide 5mg with meals.
 
# Chronic Pain/Neuropathy: Held home methadone and gabapentin 
given mental status.

# Depression: Continued home citalopram.

# Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine 88 mcg PO QD.

# GERD: Continued home PPI.

TRANSITIONAL ISSES:
- Continue zosyn through ___
- New medication: spironolactone 25mg PO daily and isosorbide 
20mg TID (for HTN)
- Recommend urogyn follow up given multiple UTIs to assess for 
neurogenic bladder given DM-related neuropathy
- Restart methadone and gabapentin cautiously if needed. These 
were held for the duration of the entire hospital stay.
- Monitor ___ closely

History of Present Illness:
___ year old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus (insulin pump), 
chronic lumbar disk disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
severe peripheral vascular disease with right BKA ___, 
chronic pain from PVD and phantom limb pain on narcotics), 
orthostatic hypotension (was on salt tabs) who presents with 
hypertension and hyperglycemia. Reportedly ___ saw her today and 
found her with altered mental status(confirmed with husband) and 
with SBP>220. No focal numbness, weakness, tingling. Denies 
fevers, chills, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, 
visual changes.  
.  
The patient did call HCA today as she was discharged yesterday 
without new MS ___ prescription and she is out at home. She 
was concerned about withdrawal but her pain was well controlled 
with oxycodone. Plan was for to pick up her prescription on 
___ morning, but to present to the ED with any concerning 
signs or symptoms in the interim.  
.  
Of note, the patient was recently admitted ___ for 
nausea/vomiting/diarrhea felt possibly due to withdrawal (from 
MS contin). She was briefly in the MICU for hypertensive 
emergency (altered mental status) and mild DKA. She was treated 
with aggressive insulin, IVF, pain control, anti-emetics and 
labetalol gtt. Cardiology was also consulted for new RBBB that 
they felt was rate related (not due to acute myocardial 
ischemia). She was ultimately transitioned to Labetalol 400mg 
TID and then to Lisinopril 5mg --> 2.5mg upon discharge (given 
history of orthostatic hypotension with frequent SBP drops by 40 
points). She was instructed to discontinue salt tabs which she 
previously took at home. Metanephrines were also sent given ?why 
she only recently became so hypertensive yet orthostatic, and so 
difficult to control.  
.  
In the ED, initial VS were: T98.2, HR81, BP178/68, RR18, 98% on 
RA. The patient was alert and oriented X3 but sleepy (easily 
aroused). She was started on IVF (2L NS) and labs notable for 
hyperglycemia (BS 358), otherwise stable Chem 7 without anion 
gap, stable CBC, normal coags. CXR and CT head were 
unremarkable. The patient was given morphine 10mg IV and then 
Metoprolol 5mg X1 IV, Labetalol 10mg X1 IV, Lisinopril 5mg PO. 
Her blood pressures remained elevated and infact, continued to 
climb into the SBP190s-200s. Her finger stick was critically 
high at 8pm and the patient gave herself 10.7 units of her 
humalog insulin pump. On repeat ~two hours later, her finger 
stick remained critically high and thus she was given regular 
insulin 10 units SQ. On recheck, her blood sugar remains 
critically high. Given her recent admission with immediate 
transfer to MICU for SBP220s and anion gap acidosis (mild), she 
was admitted to the MICU this time also. Repeat chem 10 showed 
gap 12.  She was started on a labetalol gtt and on transfer her 
vitals were 97.8po 88 23 195/60 99%ra.  

On arrival to the ___ MICU, pt is alert and oriented.  She 
reports that she just doesnt feel right and endorses polyuria.  
She denies any fevers, chills.  No chest pain, palpitations, 
changes in vision, sob, headache, dizziness.  No diarrhea or 
flushing.  Vital signs were afebrile, 177/81, 82, 13, 90% RA.

IMAGING 
EKG
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Left 
axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block. 
Compared to the previous tracing of ___, there is no 
diagnostic interim change. 
.
CXR
The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  
The 
heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  Bilaterally, 
nipple shadows are visualized.  The lungs appear clear.  The 
interstitium was more prominent on the prior examination than 
now.  There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Mild 
hyperinflation is noted.  Severe degenerative changes are partly 
visualized along the right shoulder. 
.
HEAD CT
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute process.  Stable small 
hypodense areas in the pons suggesting prior infarcts. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION

___ yo female with T1DM (insulin pump), chronic lumbar disk 
disease (chronic narcotics), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
severe peripheral vascular disease with right BKA (___), 
orthostatic hypotension (on salt tabs) recently admitted for 
hypertensive emergency (altered mental status), mild DKA and now 
presents with poorly controlled hypertension and hyperglycemia.  

.  
# Hyptertensive urgency: SBP >200s with mental status changes 
concerning for poor perfusion.  CT head did not show any acute 
changes.  She does not have any other signs of end organ 
failure.  She has had an extensive workup for her HTN including 
urine metanephrines (pending), protein electropheresis wnl, 
serum and urine tox recently neg for cocaine/amphetamines, no 
signs of hyperaldosteronism, no h/o OSA and normal renal US 
recently.  It is likely that her hx of DM has led to some renal 
parechymal vs microvascular disease leading to progressive HTN.  
HTN has not been aggressively controlled as outpt because of 
severe autonomic dysfunction resulting in orthostasis.  She was 
initially admitted to the MICU where she was started on 
labetalol 400 TID.  She remained hypertensive with BP in the 
180s. Therefore lisinopril was increased to 20 mg daily.  On 
this regimen she was noted to be orthostatic so labetalol was 
decreased to 200 TID. Prior to discharge she was able to 
ambulate with ___ without feeling dizzing, and with adequate 
control of her BP. The patient will follow-up with her PCP.  It 
is also recommended she see Neurology for evaluation of 
autonomic instability. 
.  
# Altered mental status: Given sedation in the setting of 
hypertension there was intial concern for hypertensive 
emergency.  Head CT showed no acute process and ultimately AMS 
was felt to be due to sedation from medication as well as 
possibly due to her UTI.  Mental status greatly improve in the 
MICU and she was at her baseline when she was transferred to the 
floor.
.  
# Diabetes/ r/o DKA: On admission she was noted to have 
hyperglycemia in the setting of a malfunctioning insulin pump. 
She did not have an anion gap to suggest DKA. UTI also likely 
contributing to hyperglycemia. ___ was consulted and the 
patient was maintained on lantus and HISS until mental status 
improved and she was able to manage her pump. 
. 
# UTI- UA was grossly positive.  Patient was started on 
ceftriaxone. Urine culture grew pan-sensitive E.coli. She was 
transition to cipro to complete a 7 day course.
.
STABLE ISSUES
.  
# Chronic pain: Patient endorses worsening RLE pain, 
predominantly in her toes (s/p BKA). RLE warm and well perfused 
with palpable pulses. ?Worsening peripheral vascular disease. 
She was continued on her home gabapentin, oxycodone and MScontin 
with holding parameters. Peripheral vascular disease was managed 
as below.  
.  
# Peripheral Vascular Disease: Patient was continued on her home 
plavix and zocor 
.  
# Depression: Patient was continued on her home citalopram  
..  
# Hypothyroidism:  Patient was continued on her home 
levothyroxine

IMAGING/OTHER STUDIES: 
=======================
CXR ___: FINDINGS: No significant interval change.  The lungs 
remain well expanded.  No focal consolidation, edema, effusion, 
or pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size. The mediastinum 
is not widened.  Aortic knob calcifications are mild. Deformity 
of the right distal clavicle reflects sequelae of prior 
fracture, unchanged.  Deformity and mottled sclerotic appearance 
of the right humeral head is similar to ___. 
IMPRESSION: No focal pneumonia or edema. 
  
EKG: RBBB, no significant ischemic changes. 

TTE ___ The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right 
atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler 
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure 
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear 
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic 
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the 
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly 
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar.  

CT head ___ IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ with PMH significant for T1DM c/b gastroparesis/ autonomic 
dysfunction, and PAD s/p R BKA, CAD with MI (___) without 
intervention, HTN, and HLD who presented with DKA. 

# Type I DM c/b DKA: 
Patient presented with hyperglycemia with initial anion gap of 
29, with ketones in the urine consistent with DKA. Etiology of 
DKA difficult to determine as patient reportedly took insulin 
appropriately. Initial fectious workup is negative thus far 
including UA and CXR. EKG does not show signs of ischemic 
changes although CKMB and trop up. Possibly related to viral 
gastroenteritis, as patient had epigastric discomfort/N/V prior 
to hyperglycemia. Patient followed closely by endocrinologist 
from ___ with appropriate titration in her 
insulin regimen. She maintained good glycemic control prior to 
discharge. 

# Gastroparesis: 
Patient with worsening of baseline nausea in setting of 
hyperglycemia/DKA. Given a borderline Qtc of 466, anti-emetics 
were employed cautiously. Her home reglan was discontinued given 
prolonged courses > 8 weeks are not indicated. She was trialed 
on erythromycin TID w/ meals with noted improvement in nausea 
and ability to tolerate PO. 

#CAD, NSTEMI
Noted to have a tropenemia with peak trop of 0.06 and peak CK-MB 
of 16. Patient with high pretest probability for ACS given 
previous MI, age, and multiple comorbidities (T1DM, HTN, HLD, 
PVD). No frank chest pain, but patient at risk for atypical 
angina/silent MI. Tropinemia may represent demand ischemia in 
setting of DKA/acute illness versus missed true NSTEMI. Without 
dynamic changes on ECG (baseline RBBB) and repeat echo with no 
focal wall motion abnormalities or depressed EF. Given history 
of significant vascular disease, patient received 48h of heparin 
gtt as per recommendations of the cardiology consultant. She 
also was restarted on a statin, 10mg crestor, with close 
monitoring of LFTs and CK given history of statin intolerance. 
She was continued on ASA 81 and Plavix (for PAD). Her blood 
pressure was noted to be quite labile, and she was restarted on 
her full home regimen prior to discharge. She was discharged 
with appropriate cardiology follow up where a decision can be 
made regarding the utility of a pMIBI scan and where she can 
have further titration of her cardiac regimen. 

# ___ on CKD: 
Patient presented with creatinine 2.4 from a suspected baseline 
of 1.6-2.0. Likely in setting of volume depletion in setting of 
DKA, given marked improvement with IVF hydration. 

# Complicated UTI:
Day prior to discharge, patient with T99.7 and mild 
leukocytosis. Infectious workup repeated and found to have 
significant pyuria. History of resistant E.coli in the past but 
sensitive to Bactrim. Patient was started on Bactrim DS BID for 
seven days. Cultures and sensitivities which were pending on 
discharge grew E.Coli sensitive to Bactrim.

# Urinary retention:
Patient with difficulty urinating after initial attempt of foley 
removal. Patient was passing urine spontaneously with out 
significant retention prior to discharge. 

#Hyponatremia: 
Stable/improving. Low/mid ___ from nadir of 128. Suspect 
combination of hypovolemia in setting in DKA and hypoglycemia. 
Improvement after fluid. Recent TSH wnl. 

# Deconditioning: 
Noted to be very weak after working with physical therapy and 
recommended for discharge to rehab. The patient initially 
resisted the idea but ultimately accepted and agreed that rehab 
would be the best post-discharge plan. 

# Hypertension:  
Some agents were held initially in setting of hypovolemia and 
___. Her home meds were gradually reintroduced prior to 
discharge. Noted to have significant lability with blood 
pressure with systolics ranging from 110s to 180s. Hypertension 
improved with reintroduction of home meds, but may require 
further titration as an outpatient. Plan for stopping amlodipine 
as outpatient as possible contributor to lower extremity edema.

# PAD/PVD: s/p amputation.  
Continued clopidogrel and aspirin.   
- aspirin.  

# Hypothyroidism:  
Continued levothyroxine.  

# Depression:  
Continued citalopram 20 mg daily  

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
===================
- please obtain CBC and chem7 on ___ and fax to PCP ___  
___. 
- On Bactrim DS BID for 7 days (day 1 = ___ for complicated 
UTI. 
- Started erythromycin for suspected gastroparesis. home Zofran 
held in setting of prolonged QTc. Reglan discontinued due to 
pharmacy recommendations against prolonged use for this 
indication. 
- please continue to check lft's as outpatient as patient 
started on rosuvastatin for possible CAD but with documented 
history of lft abnormalities on other prior statin. 
- continue to downtitrate amlodipine as outpatient as possible 
etiology of lower extremity edema
- hydralazine held on discharge given concern for orthostasis. 
resume as clinically indicated. 
- outpatient stress test/cardiology f/u
- continue monitoring of blood glucose as outpatient
- consider weaning methadone.
- monitor for urinary retention as patient had difficulty with 
spontaneous voiding after removal of the foley.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you during your stay at ___. You 
were admitted for a complication of your diabetes diabetic 
ketoacidosis. This was in the setting of a viral stomach bug, 
but it also appears you may have had some damage to your heart. 
Imaging of your heart showed no major changes, however, but you 
were treated with medications and should see the cardiology 
doctors as ___ outpatient. You should also have your liver tests 
monitored by your PCP because your statin was restarted. 

Your blood sugars were gradually controlled with the help of our 
diabetes doctors. ___ continue taking your insulin as 
prescribed. You were also started on a new medication called 
erythromycin to help with your gastroparesis. Please continue 
taking this medication with meals and discuss the total duration 
with your primary care doctor. Because you are on this new 
medication, you should NOT continue to take reglan. 

Please continue to monitor your blood sugar and if you have 
significantly high levels ( > 300) or frequent lows (< 70) 
please notify Dr. ___ at ___ by calling ___.  

Lastly, you were found to have a urinary tract infection and 
will need to take a medication called Bactrim for seven days. 
Please take all medications as prescribed in your discharge 
paperwork and follow up with all scheduled appointments. If you 
develop any of the danger signs listed below, please call your 
doctor immediately or go to the emergency room.

History of Present Illness:
___ female with multiple medical problems including known Type 
1 Diabetes Mellitus and autonomic dysfunction was admitted with 
syncope. 

Of note, she has had the following multiple admissions over the 
last 30 days. 
- ___ - diagnostic angiogram for right lower 
extremity claudication
- ___ - admission for right common femoral to anterior 
tibial bypass. After that admission, she was discharged on 
metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid. It is unclear why this medication was 
started. 
- ___ - admission for syncope. Patient had several 
episodes of syncope within 24 hours of discharge from rehab with 
associated arm shaking. Her beta blocker was discontinued, she 
received IVF, she was monitored on telemetry, and she ruled-out 
for an MI. She was evaluated by neurology during this admission, 
and her symptoms were thought likely related to autonomic 
dysfunction and not consistent with seizure. She had no further 
episodes and was discharged with plans to follow-up with 
neurology and cardiology.  

Since her discharge on ___, she has continued to have 
dizziness and loss of consciousness lasting for approximately 
___ and then returns to her baseline. She reportedly had 2 
episodes on the day prior to admission and then 5 episodes on 
the day of admission. For the two episodes on the day prior to 
her admission, she says that she was sitting at her table 
watching TV around 11:30am when she felt light-headed and then 
lost consciousness for several seconds. She then regained 
consciousness, and she returned to her baseline. She then had a 
second episode at 4pm or 5pm. The on the day of admission, she 
reports approximately 5 more episodes in rapid succession while 
watching TV. She says that she has otherwise been eating well 
and no episodes of chest pain, numbness, tingling, focal motor 
weakness, urinary or fecal incontinence. Review of systems is 
otherwise notable for one loose stool on the morning of 
admission.

She has undergone a thorough cardiac evaluation in 
electrophysiology clinic for her syncope, and her symptoms were 
thought most likely related to orthostatic hypotension. Her 
cardiac evaluation has included a ___ of Hearts 
monitor, and echocardiogram.

Upon arrival to the ED, temp 96.6, HR 72, BP 114/68, RR 16, and 
pulse ox 100% on room air. Exam was notable for being 
orthostatic  with BP decrease from 121/60 to 92/57 and HR from 
64 to 67  with lying down to standing in the ED. Labs were 
notable for serum aspirin level of 4 and hct 30.5. CT Head was 
unremarkable. She received approximately 1 L IVF. 

Review of systems:  
(+) Per HPI. light-headedness, passing out, loose stool x 1.
(-) Denies pain, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss,

Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with h/o longstanding DM I with triopathy, PAD s/p 
recent bypass, Hypothyroidism, known autonomic dysfunction 
admitted with recurrent syncope. Found to be orthostatic on 
admission with mild ARF on CKD. Got IVFs with improvement. Is 
encouraged to keep hydrated. She had no events on tele but she 
also had no syncopal events here either. Pt was seen again by 
neuro here who felt it was still c/w autonomic dysfunction/vagal 
hypersensitivity/chronotropic incompetence. She reports some 
episodes when lying down, which doesnt really support the 
hypothesis. Pt thinks it may have happened with turning her head 
to L side, brings up carotid hypersensivity but only 1 episode 
so not clear, she will pay attention if recurrs. Note, repeat 
carotid US here stable L 60-69% disease. Per NEuro, got EEG to 
complete w/u though very low suspicion, which was normal. Plan 
is to encourage PO hydration, started salt tabs, wear graduated 
thigh stockings to maintain BP, avoid prolonged 
standing/sitting, keep legs elevated, minimize narcotics and 
ativan. her gabapentin dose was reduced from 800bid to ___ qhs 
as well (also to renally dose). Instructed NOT to drive. She 
should follow up with Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. Other 
issue was her groin wound, which was slightly open and red along 
the incision, but no induration or fluctuance to suggest wound 
infection/cellulitis at this time and she did not have any 
fever/leukocytosis. given she is diabetic and high risk, we set 
up ___ for wound care at home. She has f/u with Dr. ___ on 
___. 
.
See below for daily progress note for further details:
.
Recurrent Syncope: In recent and past evaluations, has been 
attributed to autonomic dysfunction/vagal 
hypersensitivity->orthostatic hypotension w/o HR response. Taken 
off all BP meds. Has had cardiac eval in past unrevealing (no EP 
study though). Unusual that she reports syncopal episodes in 
lying down position->does not support above hypothosesis and 
brings up carotid hypersensitivity (pt thinks may have occured 
with head turned to L).  Has known L carotid disease but stable 
at 69% on US here. No evnets on tele but also no syncopal events 
while here. Fluids help orthostasis but pt easily again 
orthostatic when off. Repeat eval by neuro still feel mostly 
autonomic dysfunction with orthostasis and chronotropic 
incompetence. Encourage PO hydration, started salt tabs, Rx 
graduated stockings to maintain BP. finally, advised to minimize 
narcotics for pain and decrease dose of neurontin as both can 
worsen. F/u Dr. ___ in ___ clinic re: further 
management (?florinef)
.
ARF on CKD II: Creat 1.6 on admission, improved to 1.2 
(baseline) with IVFs.  PO hydration
-renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
.
Wound Care: groin incision with opening and some exudate but no 
clear pus/fluctuance/induration> mild surrounding erythema and 
soreness along incision but no clear cellulitis. pt afebrile. no 
leukocytosis. is diabetic and high risk. will set up home ___ 
for wound checks and low threshold to start Abx. For pain 
control, encouraged to take tylenol and minimize narcotics as 
above

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ presented to the ___ emergency department on 
___, after a fall onto her right hip.  She was evaluated by 
the orthopaedic and vascular surgery service.  She was noted to 
have a right hip fracture.  She was admitted, consented, and 
prepped for surgery.  On ___ she was taken to the operating 
room and underwent an ORIF of her right hip fracture.  She 
tolerated the procedure well, was extubated, transferred to the 
recovery room, and then to the floor.  On ___ she was also 
transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells due to acute 
blood loss anemia.  On the floor she was seen by physical 
therapy to improve her strength and mobility. On the night of 
post op day one (___) pt's Foley was removed, however, she 
failed to void after 8 hours and was bladder scanned for 450cc. 
A Foley was replaced for acute urinary retention.  On ___ she 
was again transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells due 
to acute blood loss anemia. Shortly after receiving the second 
unit of blood, pt complained of increasing epigastric 
discomfort. EKG and CXR were unchanged from her baseline and 
unremarkable. However, given her diabetes and risk for atypical 
angina, cardiac enzymes were cycled. Medicine consultation was 
obtained and recommended continued cycling of enzymes (x3) and 
attributed the symptoms either to the initial fall (ie muscle 
spasm) or to minor transfusion reaction. The transfusion team 
was notified and the pt was monitored. On the day of discharge 
pt is no longer experiencing chest pain and has had three sets 
of negative cardiac enzymes. Pt was cleared by medicine to d/c 
to rehab with follow up by her PCP as an ___ in the next 2 
weeks. 

The rest of her hospital stay was uneventful with her lab data 
and vital signs within normal limits and her pain controlled.  
She is being discharged today in stable condition.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with DM1, PVD s/p recent 
fem-tib bypass on ___, chronic syncopal symptoms thought to 
be secondary to autonomic dysfunction and lisinopril, who 
presents with worsening syncope. She was in her USOH until today 
after leaving rehab yesterday when she was noted to have five to 
six episodes of syncope with brief periods of LOC x ___ and 
bilateral arm shaking while laying in bed (witnessed by visiting 
nurse). At baseline, she had significant syncope a few months 
ago that was characterized by light-headedness when standing 
from a seated position; this resolved with discontinuation of 
lisinopril, and she has only had a few brief episodes of 
diziness over the last few months. Note that she has been 
evaluated by cardiology (Dr. ___ and had negative ___ of 
Hearts monitoring. ROS was negative for incontinence, headache, 
fevers, chills, new medications, CP, and SOB.  

In the ED, vital signs were initially: 98.8 64 142/77 18 100. 
EKG was negative and CXR and head CT were unrevealing. She was 
orthostatic (sbp 140 -> 110) and received 2L IVF and aspirin. 
She was seen by neuro who felt that her symptoms were not 
secondary to seizures or other acute processes, but rather 
secondary to her known autonomic dysfunction. She also had an 
episode of arm shaking in the ED for a few seconds that was 
thought to be a seizure but again felt by neuro to be more 
related to her orthostatic hypotension per report. She was also 
felt to have some erythema at the location of her leg 
wound/fem-tib bypass.

There is no 
evidence of focal lesions within the limitations of an 
unenhanced scan.  There is no evidence of intrahepatic or 
extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The gallbladder is within 
normal limits.  Contrast within the gallbladder may represent 
vicarious excretion from prior exam. 
PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, 
without evidence of focal lesions within the limitations of an 
unenhanced scan.  There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation.  
There is no peripancreatic stranding.

Stomach is 
otherwise unremarkable.  Small bowel loops demonstrate normal 
caliber and wall thickness throughout.  The colon is within 
normal limits.  There is a 
significant amount of stool within the rectum with mild adjacent 
stranding, potentially representing stercoral proctitis.  The 
appendix is normal.

abdominal pain, and obstipation c/w prior episodes of 
gastroparesis (treated with disimpaction and antiemetics), 
course complicated by profound AMS, most likely iso of hepatic 
encephalopathy vs. severe constipation, also with UTI (treated 
with zosyn), mental status much improved to baseline with 
administration of antibiotics and bowel regimen including 
lactulose enemas.

#Unresponsiveness: 
#Hepatic encephalopathy: Patient had 2 episodes of 
unresponsiveness on ___ AM @0800 and @1215, going from A&Ox3 to 
arousing only to a sternal/clavicular rub. Code stroke was 
called. Exam was notable for new asterixis, patient had had CT 
A/P ___ on admission which was concerning for new cirrhosis. 
CBC notable for new WBC 20.2, urine culture from ___ grew 
pansensitive proteus and MDR Ecoli, patient was treated for 
complicated cystitis with IV zoysn (also was briefly on 
vancomycin ___. EKG was without new ischemic changes, and 
was unchanged w/RBBB and LAFB. MB flat at 1 and trop 0.05<-.04. 
Given c/f stroke, NCHCT was obtained, which was w/o acute 
infarct, and was notable for chronic ___ ischemic changes, and 
overall parenchymal atrophy. 24h EEG was negative for 
electrographic seizures, did show focal slowing in the temporal 
regions, L>R, indicative of subcortical dysfunction in these 
regions. LP was not suggestive of an infectioius etiology. 
Overall c/f toxic-metabolic encephalopathy iso infection (UTI vs 
bacterial translocation iso colitis noted on CT A/P) vs 
cirrhosis given asterixis and new finding of nodular liver on CT 
A/P. Hepatology had been consulted and patient was stared on TID 
lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy. It should be 
noted that patient's home methadone 5mg TID (indication: chronic 
pain) was held iso AMS, constipation, and longQTc. Patient's 
mental status improved with lactulose and antibiotic treatment 
and methadone was not restarted on discharge given absence of 
pain. 

#Nausea/vomiting/constipation:
#Epigastric abdominal pain 
#Gastroparesis flare: Patient with hx of gastroparesis 
characterized by nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which is 
managed with PO metoclopramide, PO zofran, as well as standing 
docusate, senna, and miralax at home. Patient had nausea and 
multiple episodes of vomiting for the last 48hrs prior to 
admission. Unknown etiology of flare, no evidence for cardiac 
event, possibly iso cystitis or severe constipation. KUB w/o 
evidence of obstruction, but w/transverse colon dilatation c/w 
colonic ileus. CT A/P showed large stool burden potentially 
representing stercoral proctitis, nodular liver suggesting 
cirrhosis. She was manually disimpacted in the ED. Elevated QTc 
(likely iso methadone, home antiemetics), affected antiemetic 
regimen. Patient was largely given IV reglan and Ativan. Given 
ongoing nausea/vomiting, NGT was placed ___. There was some 
concern for a GIB given black appearing emesis, though this was 
gastroccult NEGATIVE. Hepatology did not think there was any 
need for urgent EGD, GIB unlikely. Repeat CT A/P ___ showed 
expected sequelae of previously noted stercoral colitis. Course 
was been complicated by hypovolemia, patient with dry mucous 
membranes on exam with likely hypovolemic hyponatremia and 
elevated Cr. She was given IVF repletion and briefly started on 
tube feeds. Patient was evaluated by speech and swallow prior to 
discharge who recommended nectar thick liquids and ground solids 
(see full recommendations below). Antiemetic regimen was 
converted to PO prior to discharge, patient will continue on PO 
reglan. 

# Complicated cystitis: Patient with chronic indwelling Foley 
(was d/c'd with Foley on ___ in the setting of urge 
incontinence ___ diabetic neuropathy. UA positive in ED, UCx 
speciated pansensitive proteus and MDR Ecoli (resistant to 
ampicillin/cefazolin/CTX/cipro, sensitive to 
___. Foley catheter was 
replaced. Patient was treated with full course of IV zosyn for 
complicated cystitis. She will have follow-up with urogynecology 
as an outpatient for evaluation for foley removal. Foley last 
changed on ___.

# Hypertension: Patient has a hx of labile blood pressures. SBPs 
in the 130s-180s during the day with peaks into the 200s 
overnight with tachycardia not responding to IV hydralazine, 
though seemed to respond to PO labetolol prn. Patient denied any 
headache, visual changes, lightheadedness, or dizziness. 
Carvedilol 6.25mg BID was started with only mild improvement in 
BPs, uptitrated to 6.25AM and 12.5PM given ___ HTN. Patient 
continues with ___ systolic HTN, SBPs 150-180s. Options for 
further increases as an outpatient: can increase lisinopril or 
possibly make BID, can increase clonidine/imdur further, can 
increase AM carvedilol. 

# Cirrhosis on CT A/P: Cirrhosis noted on CT A/P on ___ and 
on ___, transaminases on admission wnl though w/mildly 
elevated Alk phos. Normal synthetic function, INR ~1.1. Followed 
by Dr. ___. Hepatic dysfunction was initially seen 
(transaminitis) while on atorvastatin in late ___. At that 
time, she had negative serologies for HAV, HBV, and HCV, neg 
anti-mitochondrial Ab, no e/o iron overload w/ferritin 184 and 
TIBC 325, ___ positive at 1:160, anti-Sm positive at 1:20, and 
neg anti-microsomal liver/kidney Ab, and liver biopsy c/w 
autoimmune hepatitis, as well as some fibrosis thought to be 
caused by the prior, as well as coexistent fatty liver disease; 
fibrosis was not yet cirrhosis. Transaminitis improved once 
atorvastatin was discontinued, and likely etiology of hepatitis 
was statin-induced autoimmune hepatitis. Plan is for patient to 
follow-up with Dr. ___ in ___ for fibroscan and then to 
obtain serial RUQ U/S q6months if c/w cirrhosis as well as upper 
endoscopy to look for varices. 

# Normocytic anemia - Patient with chronic anemia likely 
secondary to acute on chronic illness, phlebotomy and poor 
nutrition. She was transfused one unit PRBCs prior to discharge, 
though Hb nadir of 6.2 was likely spurious. Reticulocyte count 
was appropriately elevated in the setting of acute on chronic 
anemia. Iron studies consistent with ACD, ferritin elevated to 
181 (Iron 58, Fe sat 41%). Hb on day prior to discharge: 8.3. 

# Type 1 Diabetes: Patient has history of labile blood sugars 
and intermittent asymptomatic hypoglycemia. HgA1c 6.2 on 
___. Has been followed by ___ during previous admissions. 
She has been stable on lantus 6U QAM and 8U QHS and novolog 2+1 
for every 50 mg/dL starting at 150 at meals and 1+1 for every 50 
mg/dL starting at 200 at bedtime. FSGs in the 100s-300s
- Continued home lantus 6U QAM and 8U QHS
- HISS using patient's home regimen as described 

# Chronic kidney disease stage III: 
# Urinary retention: Pt admitted with Cr 1.7, which is her b/l 
Cr 1.7-1.8 in setting of CKD. Hx of urge incontinence with 
retention from diabetic induced urinary neuropathy, and had 
required intermittent straight cath for retention during last

well. Was d/c'ed on ___ with foley, which was replaced in 
the ED given cystitis.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================

incontinence and failure to void on her own. Replaced on 
___. Should be replaced monthly. Scheduled for follow up 
with urology upon discharge for evaluation and removal as well 
as monitoring of hematuria.

- Patient admitted on methadone that was stopped secondary to

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted to the hospital because you were having nausea 
and vomiting, most likely due to your known gastroparesis.  You 
were also severely constipated, which likely worsened your 
symptoms.  You were disimpacted (manual removal of stool) and 
given medications to treat your nausea and constipation.  

Your hospitalization was complicated by confusion and 
unresponsiveness.  You had imaging of your brain, an EEG (to 
check for seizures), and blood tests, all of which were 
unremarkable.  The neurologists came to evaluate you and did not 
think that you were having a stroke or seizure.  You did have a 
CT scan of your belly, which showed liver abnormalities 
(cirrhosis).  The liver doctors ___ that your confusion may 
have been related to liver disease.  You were also treated for a 
urinary tract infection, which can make you more confused.  Your 
thinking became much clearer with the administration of 
antibiotics and medications to ensure frequent bowel movements.  
Your methadone was also stopped to avoid any worsening 
confusion.  

It is very important that you take your medications as 
prescribed, we have made the following changes:
- REDUCED your citalopram from 20mg to 10mg daily. Please stop 
this medication after 3 weeks because it interacts with many of 
your other medications
- STOPPED your methadone because it is no longer needed 
- SCHEDULED an aggressive bowel regimen with senna, Colace, and 
miralax. We also STARTED lactulose to be used if you have not 
had a bowel movement in 48 hours. 
- STARTED Carvedilol 6.25mg in the morning and 12.5mg at night 
for your blood pressure. 

Please follow-up with your doctors as listed below.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team
