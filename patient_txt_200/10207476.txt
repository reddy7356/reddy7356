STUDIES:  
___ CXR:  
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable in appearance. There 
is  
a new right subclavian central venous catheter with tip 
overlying the expected region of the cavoatrial junction. No 
pneumothorax is detected. The lungs are clear.  
.  
___ EKG 2249: sinus brady 56bpm, low voltage limb leads, no 
ste, std, twi, QTc 503 (elevated)  
.  
___ CT ABD/PELVIS (w/o contrast) - PRELIM  
1. No acute intra-abdominal pathology.  
2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta and 
its branches, without focal dilatation or aneurysm. However, 
please note that the patient's known saccular descending 
thoracic aortic arch aneurysm is not evaluated on this study.  
.
___ TTE:  The left atrium and right atrium are normal in 
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and 
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to 
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality 
cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic 
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is 
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral 
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No 
structural cardiac cause of syncope identified. 
Compared with the prior report (images unvailable for review) of 
___, the findings are similar. 
.
___ LUE venous ultrasound: 1. Thrombus in the distal 
cephalic vein adherent to the indwelling venous catheter 
consistent with superficial thrombophlebitis.
2. No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
.
___ Rectal mucosal biopsy: Within normal limits. No viral 
inclusions or tumor seen.
.
___ CTA chest: 
1. No dissection or PE is identified. There is a stable small 
saccular aneurysm along the inferior aspect of the descending 
aortic arch.
2. New small regions of subpleural ground-glass opacity in the 
right upper lobe. Appearance is nonspecific.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions left greater than right, 
new compared to the previous examination.
.
___ CT chest:
1. Interval increase in size and extent of predominantly 
right-sided ground- glass opacities. The differential diagnosis 
would include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia as well as 
atypical infections including atypical mycobacterial infection.
2. Stable bilateral pleural effusions.
.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
# Sepsis - Upon admission, the patient had a picture concerning 
for sepsis given fever, leukocytosis, bandemia & diarrhea.  
Source, however, remained unclear.   CT of abd/pelvis without 
pathology, and degree of described diarrhea seemed inconsistent 
with her degree of hypotension.  Differential diagnosis also 
included hypovolemia secondary to diarrhea, ACS with + trop 
(though more likely ___ demand ischemia,) and adrenal 
insufficiency likely contributing to profound hypotension on 
admission given marginal cortisol stim test on day of admission. 
 She had normal CVPs and SVO2s and adequate renal function 
making cardiogenic shock unlikely.  Patient was bolused with a 
total of 6L on admission, and pressures were supported with 
levophed. Pressors were successfully weaned.  The patient was 
given stress dose steroids given marginal cortisol stim test in 
the setting of chronic steroid use.  Stool cultures were 
negative and her diarrhea decreased in frequency and amount.  
Patient had an unchanged CXR.  Patient was started on 
vanc/cipro/flagyl for broad spectrum coverage, and given 
negative cultures for 48hrs, vanc was discontinued on day of 
transfer to the floor.  DFA, viral sputum cultures, urine 
culture, urine legionella, and blood cultures were all negative. 
 The patients hydrocortisone was switched to predisone at a 
lower converted dose, and aggressively tapered.
.
On ___, the patient became hypotensive with SBP in the ___ and 
fevers/rigors. She also desatted to 89% on RA. She received ~5L 
IVF and stabilized to 100-110s, O2 sat improved and she was put 
back on room air. CT revealed small ground glass opacities in 
the RUL concerning for a possible pneumonia. She was started on 
meropenem, linezolid, and azithromycin for broad coverage 
however no source of infection was found. Urine legionella 
negative. Discontinued linezolid on ___ as no evidence for 
staph bacteremia. She developed a drug rash and meropenem was 
continued. She completed a 7 day course of azithromycin for 
empiric pneumonia coverage. She remained in the hospital for one 
week after this event and her blood pressure remained stable 
throughout.
.
# Syncopal episode - On ___ the patient had a syncopal episode 
in the setting of rising from seated position. She was 
unresponsive for approx 30 seconds. Vitals demonstrated systolic 
BP of 78 and HR ___. She awoke quickly and BP responded to 
fluids appropriately. This was felt most consistent with 
vasovagal syncope. No events on telemetry. This was in the 
setting of adrenal insufficiency and she had been rapidly 
tapered from stress dose steroids after being transferred out of 
the MICU. Her prednisone dose was increased after this episode 
and tapered slowly. She was discharged on 10mg prednisone daily.
  
# N/V/Diarrhea- The patient has no recent antibiotic use. 
Differential diagnosis includes bacterial vs viral infection vs 
GVHD.  CT abd/pelvis without evidence of colitis or SBO.  LFTs 
unremarkable.  Stool cultures without growth to date.  Currently 
tolerating regular diet but continued to have loose stools. 
Underwent flex sigmoidoscopy on ___. Path results pending. 
Cipro/flagyl were discontinued out of concern for contributing 
to drug rash (see below).
.
# ARF – The patient presented with creatinine of 1.4 (baseline 
0.9-1.1) & non gap acidosis likely secondary to diarrhea, 
bicarbonate loss & NS resuscitation. Creatinine trended down to 
baseline with IVF and hyperchloremic acidosis resolved. 

# ONC - The patient is with a history or erythroleukemia 
evolving from MDS ___, s/p allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched 
sibling donor on ___, complicated by mild GVHD diagnosis 
___ and started on prednisone.  Patient was continued on 
prophylaxis of acyclovir, fluconazole, pentamadine for PCP 
___.  Stress dose hyrocortisone was given in setting of 
sepsis, and her dose was rapidly tapered. She was discharged on 
10mg prednisone daily for GVH prophylaxis.   

# Cardiac - On admission, the patient denied chest pain or 
shortness of breath.  In the setting of hypotension and 
tachycardia on admission, she had anterior ST segment 
depressions.  Serial enzymes were were levated, with a peak 
troponin of 1.12 which trended downward.  With fluid 
resuscitation and resolution of tachycardia, the ischemic 
changes on her EKG resolved.  Thus they were felt to be demand 
ischemia in the setting of sepsis.  Patient essentially failed 
physiologic stress test, and should have out patient cardiac 
follow up with exercise stress test.  Echo was unchanged, with 
preserved systolic function.  In addition to the EKG changes 
noted above, her rhythm was sinus bradycardia & new prolonged QT 
on admission.  Repeat EKG showed QT in 480s, sinus brady. On 
___ the patient had a syncopal episode as above. No symptoms of 
chest pain, no ECG changes. Repeat CE demonstrate flat CK but 
troponin of 0.59. Discussed with cardiology and was felt to not 
be consistent with ACS.
.
# Drug rash - The patient developed 2 drug rashes during her 
admission, felt most likely to be due to a reaction to 
ceftriaxone and meropenem. She had elevated peripheral 
eosinophils which supports this. She was evaluated by 
dermatology, who agreed. She was instructed that unless needed 
in a critical situation, she should not take these antibiotics.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: She was not on a statin, however she was 
recruited to an ED sepsis trial involving statins and was put on 
the study drug.
.
# GERD - She was continued on her outpatient regimen of 
protonix. 
.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Her diabetes is diet-controlled at 
home. She was covered with a regular insulin sliding scale 
during her hospitalization.
.

paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on xarelto and metoprolol, mild 
mitral regurgitation, aortic aneurysm status post EVAR, history 
of JAK2+ myeloproliferative disorder, AML s/p alloHSCT in ___ 
c/b GVHD (pulmonary) on prednisone with recent admission for 
diarrhea and dehydration who presents with fatigue and concern 
for low heart rate on home monitor. 

The patient was admitted from ___ was diarrhea, which 
improved without infectious source. This was attributed to 
metformin, and her dose was subsequently capped at 500 mg BID. 
She felt much better after this discharge, and has been in 
general feeling well subsequently without any focal complaint 
beyond some fatigue and vision issues in the setting of an eye 
condition managed by an ophthalmologist. She cannot clarify 
further, but thinks all her vision issues are related to this. 

On the morning of presentation she checked her BP and HR as she 
does every day. On her blood pressure automatic cuff, the 
readings including 134/68 (HR 44), 144/57 (91), 149/90 (48), and 
144/71 (84) in succession. Her daughter, a medical assistant 
urged her to go in to get evaluated, which made her anxious and 
around this time she began to feel unlike herself. She cannot 
clarify with any more details, but does not feel this sensation 
currently. She thus presented to the ___ ED.

VPBs, 85 bpm with inferior Q waves and R in V1 suggesting prior 
inferior/posterior infarct. Similar to prior regarding Q waves. 
- cardiology was consulted given concern for bradycardia, and 
they felt that the low pulse reading may be related to bigeminy 
and inability of automated cuff to appropriately detect heart 
rate, though recommended admission for monitoring with telemetry 
- vitals prior to transfer were 97.9, 67, 120/60 16 96% RA

On arrival to the floor, patient denies fevers/chills, night 
sweats, headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness/numbnesss,

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___

___ was a pleasure taking care of you at ___ 
___.  You were admitted to the hospital after 
placement of a stent graft in your aorta to strengthen the part 
of the artery that was weakened by an aneurysm. You were 
premedicated with prednisone due to your dye allergy. To perform 
this procedure, small punctures were made in the arteries on 
both sides of your groin.  You tolerated the procedure well and 
are now ready to be discharged from the hospital.   Please 
follow the recommendations below to ensure a speedy and 
uneventful recovery.

 

Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery

Endovascular Thoracic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair Discharge 
Instructions

 

PLEASE NOTE: After endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), it is 
very important to have regular appointments (every ___ months) 
for the rest of your life.  These appointments will include a 
MRI(“Magnetic resonance Imaging”) scan and/or ultrasound of your 
graft.  If you miss an appointment, please call to reschedule. 

WHAT TO EXPECT:

·     Bruising, tenderness, and a sensation of fullness at the 
groin puncture sites (or incisions) is normal and will go away 
in one-two weeks

CARE OF THE GROIN PUNCTURE SITES:

·     It is normal to have mild swelling, a small bruise, or 
small amounts of drainage at the groin puncture sites.  In two 
weeks, you may feel a small, painless, pea sized knot at the 
puncture sites.  This too is normal.  Male patients may notice 
swelling in the scrotum.  The swelling will get better over 
one-two weeks.

·     Look at the area daily to see if there are any changes.  
Be sure to report signs of infection.  These include: increasing 
redness; worsening pain; new or increasing drainage, or drainage 
that is white, yellow, or green; or fever of 101.5 or more.  (If 
you have taken aspirin, Tylenol, or other fever reducing 
medicine, wait at least ___ hours after taking it before you 
check your temperature in order to get an accurate reading.)

FOR SUDDEN, SEVERE BLEEDING OR SWELLING (Groin puncture site or 
incision)

·     If you have sudden, severe bleeding or swelling at either 
of the groin puncture sites: 

-Lie down, keep leg straight and apply (or have someone apply) 
firm pressure to area for ___ minutes with a gauze pad or 
clean cloth. 

-Once bleeding has stopped, call your surgeon to report what 
happened.   

-If bleeding does not stop, call ___ for transfer to closest 
Emergency Room. 

·     You may shower 48 hours after surgery.  Let the soapy 
water run over the puncture sites, then rinse and pat dry.  Do 
not rub these sites and do not apply cream, lotion, ointment or 
powder. 

·     Wear loose-fitting pants and clothing as this will be less 
irritating to the groin puncture sites. 

MEDICATIONS

·     Take aspirin daily.  Aspirin helps prevent blood clots 
that could form in your repaired artery. 

·     It is very important that you never stop taking aspirin or 
other blood thinning medicines-even for a short while- unless 
the surgeon who repaired your aneurysm tells you it is okay to 
stop.   Do not stop taking them, even if another doctor or nurse 
tells you to, without getting an okay from the surgeon who first 
prescribed them. 

·     You will be given prescriptions for any new medication 
started during your hospital stay.

·     Before you go home, your nurse ___ give you information 
about new medication and will review all the medications you 
should take at home.  Be sure to ask any questions you may have. 
 If something you normally take or may take is not on the list 
you receive from the nurse, please ask if it is okay to take it. 


PAIN MANAGEMENT

·     Most patients do not have much pain following this 
procedure.   Your puncture sites may be a little sore.  This 
will improve daily. If it is getting worse, please let us know.

·     You will be given instructions about taking pain medicine 
if you need it.

ACTIVITY

·     You must limit activity to protect the puncture sites in 
your groin.  For ONE WEEK:

-Do not drive

-Do not swim, take a tub bath or go in a Jacuzzi or hot tub

-Do not lift, push, pull or carry anything heavier than five 
pounds

-Do not do any exercise or activity that causes you to hold your 
breath or bear down with your abdominal muscles.

-Do not resume sexual activity

·     Discuss with your surgeon when you may return to other 
regular activities, including work.  If needed, we will give you 
a letter for your workplace. 

·     It is normal to feel weak and tired.  This can last 
six-eight weeks, but should get better day by day.   You may 
want to have help around the house during this time.

·     ___ push yourself too hard during your recovery.  Rest 
when you feel tired.  Gradually return to normal activities over 
the next month.

·     We encourage you to walk regularly. Walking, especially 
outdoors in good weather is the best exercise for circulation.  
Walk short distances at first, even in the house, then do a 
little more each day.

·     It is okay to climb stairs.  You may need to climb them 
slowly and pause after every few steps. 

 

DIET

·     It is normal to have a decreased appetite.  Your appetite 
will return over time.

·     Follow a well balance, heart-healthy diet, with moderate 
restriction of salt and fat. 

·     Eat small, frequent meals with nutritious food options 
(high fiber, lean meats, fruits, and vegetables) to maintain 
your strength and to help with wound healing.

BOWEL AND BLADDER FUNCTION

·     You should be able to pass urine without difficulty.  Call 
you doctor if you have any problems urinating, such as burning, 
pain, bleeding, going too often, or having trouble urinating or 
starting the flow of urine.   Call if you have a decrease in the 
amount of urine. 

·     You may experience some constipation after surgery because 
of pain medicine and changes in activity.  Increasing fluids and 
fiber in your diet and staying active can help.  To relief 
constipation, you may talk a mild laxative.   Please take to 
your pharmacist for advice about what to take. 

SMOKING

·     If you smoke, it is very important that you STOP.   
Research shows smoking makes vascular disease worse. This could 
increase the chance of a blockage in your new graft.  Talk to 
your primary care physician about ways to quit smoking.

Tracing at 10:29am
Regular Sinus at 65 bpm, Regular intervals, Leftward axis, 1mm
STD I, aVL (downward sloping) wiht 1mm STE in III, aVF, and
possibly in II as well suggesting inferior active ischemia. 

Tracing at 15:59:26
Sinus bradycardia at HR 51 bpm, Q waves in II (1mmx0.5mm), III,
aVF, TWI in III aVF still with ~0.5-1mm STE. Right sided leads

CXR ___:
1. No acute intrathoracic pathology is noted. 
2. Rim-like lucency is noted under the left hemidiaphragm, the
presence of free air cannot be excluded. If further evaluation 
is
required, right lateral decubitus views of the abdomen can be
obtained. 

Cardiac Cath ___
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 
severe 2 vessel coronary disease. The LMCA was normal. The LAD 
had a mid 
90% stenosis. The LCX had no obstructive coronary disease. The 
RCA had 
serial stenoses, the greatest of which was 99% in the 
mid-portion with 
evidence of thrombus or dissection. 2. Resting hemodynamics 
revealed 
normal systemic arterial blood pressure with an SBP of 136 mm 
Hg. 3. 
Left ventriculography was not performed. Successful 
thrombectomy, and 
direct stenting of the proximal and mid RCA lesions with 
overlapping 
(distal to proximal) 3x33, 3.5x13,3.5x23, 3.5x13mm cypher stents 
post 
dilated to 4.0mm. Final angiography revealed 0% residual 
stenosis, no 
angiographically apparent dissection and timi 3 flow. The 
patient left 
the lab free of angina and in stable condition (see ___ 
comments). 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease. 
.
TTE (Focused views) Done ___
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
with focal basal to mid inferior akinesis. Overall left 
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The 
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with free wall 
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened 
but aortic stenosis is not present. The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior 
space which most likely represents a fat pad. There are no 
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. 
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the inferior wall motion abnormality is new and the right 
ventricular basal free wall motion abnormality is also new. 
Additional views maybe helpful to fully assess the right 
ventricle.  
 
Brief Hospital Course:
1. MYOCARDIAL ELEVATION, TRANSIENT ST ELEVATION
The patinet was started on heparin in the ED after she developed 
transient ST elevations in inferior leads and lateral STD; 
initial cardiac enzymes were negative. ECG evolved over the next 
six hours with TWI in interior leads and resolution of lateral 
STD. Biomarkers returned positive later (peak CK 1500, peak 
troponin 6.89 at 2p ___, and she was started on integrilin and 
plavix loaded with 600mg PO x1. She had no further episodes of 
her presenting constellation of symptoms, but did have 
intermittent epigastric discomfort and nausea. ECG on am of 
___ had reemergence of lateral STD and she was taken to the 
catheterization lab.  4 stents were placed in the RCA.  LAD 
lesion not intervened upon as it was not the culprit lesion.  
Post Cath ECHO showed EF 44% and basal hypokinesis.  Unclear 
what options remain for intervention should she develop in-stent 
thrombosis/restenosis or LAD occlusion; CABG may be an option.  
Dr. ___ was scheduled to evaluate as an outpt ___ and 
discuss these options.   Continued medical therapy with ASA, 
Plavix, statin, betablocker.  Patient was transitioned to toprol 
XL 25mg daily prior to discharge.

2. ANAPHYLACTOID/CONTRAST ALLERGY
The patient developed an anaphylactoid reaction to IV contrast 
used during cardiac cath.  Prior to the procedure on ___, 
she was started on fluids, diphenhydramine 50mg po, ranitidine 
150mg po, methylprednisolone 125mg IV, and prednisone 40mg as 
pretreatment for a known iodidine allergy. She received 150mL of 
Omnipaque and 220mL of Optiray during the procedure.  The 
evening of her procedure she developed generalized erythema. She 
had no other complaints at the time, SBP was ___, and exam was 
normal except for diffuse blanching erythema. She was treated 
with diphenhydramine 50mg po and continued on IVF. She had a 
post-cath check at 9:40pm, at which time her VS included T 
100.0, BP 110/53, and she was given an IVF bolus. A trigger was 
called at midnight ___ for BP 71/31, with HR 94 and T 102.8. 
Exam was unchanged and with clear lungs, ECG with Q waves and 
<1mm STE inferiorly. Repeat labs showed stable Hct, CEs trending 
down, creatinine 1.4 up from 0.9. She was given diphenhydramine 
50mg po, fexofenadine 60mg, and IV fluids. SBPs persisted in the 
___, so she was given epinephrine 0.3mg x 2. She was transferred 
to the CCU for close monitoring and dopamine.  Allergy was 
consulted and felt an anaphylactoid to IV contrast was most 
consistent with the patient's known allergies; allergy 
recommended 125mg IV Solumedrol x3 days followed by a taper. She 
was quickly titrated off dopamine and her blood pressures 
normalized.  The patient was also treated with standing 
diphenhydramine and ranitidine.  Her rash erythema improved. 
Upon discharge, the patient was prescribed prednisone 60 mg PO 
on ___, 50 mg PO on ___, 40 mg PO on ___, 30 mg PO on ___, 20 
mg PO on ___, and from ___ and onward 10 mg daily until 
otherwise directed by her outpatient team.
.
3. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's course was complicated by 
prerenal failure from poor forward flow in setting of 
hypotension; her acute renal failure improved to 1.0 as she 
became normotensive.
.
4. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY:  She was diagnosed by cortisol stim 
test during admission last year.  Steroids were being tapered 
off slowly, was down to 10mg daily.  Received 125mg 
methylprednisolone in setting of hypotension initially, then 
steroid regimen as per anaphylactoid reaction treatment 
described above.
.
5. DM2: Diet-controlled at baseline.  Blood glucose was elevated 
secondary to steroids.  She was provided with sliding scale 
insulin.

cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic 
function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35%) secondary to 
hypokinesis of the inferior septum and posterior wall and 
akinesis of the inferior free wall. The right ventricular free 
wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular chamber size is 
normal with depressed free wall contractility. The diameters of 
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The 
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic 
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, 
posteriorly directed jet of at least moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the 
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly 
underestimated (Coanda effect). The estimated pulmonary artery 
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
mitral regurgitation is increased.

___ Stress INTERPRETATION: This ___ year old IDDM woman with 
h/o CAD s/p MI and CABG in ___, asthma and CHF was referred to 
the lab for evaluation. She was infused with 0.4 mg of 
regadenoson over 20 seconds. No chest, arm, neck or back 
discomfort reported. In the setting of baseline NSSTTWs, at 
___ seconds post infusion a 0.5 mm horizontal ST segment 
depression with TWI noticed in the inferior leads and V4-V6. 
These ST segment changes returned to baseline by 2 minutes 
post-infusion with 
IV administration of 125 mg of aminophylline. Rhythm was sinus 
with rare 
isolated VPBs and occasional isolated APBs. Appropriate HR and 
BP 
response to the infusion. 
  
IMPRESSION : Non-specific EKG changes in the absence of anginal 
type 
symptoms. Nuclear report sent separately. 

___ Myocardial Perfusion Study IMPRESSION: 1. Severe fixed 
defect in the inferior wall and moderate fixed 
defect in the apex is identified. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old F with a PMH significant for 
JAK2-positive myeloproliferative disorder, AML status post 
allogeneic stem cell transplant (___), complicated by graft 
versus host disease, including pulmonary GVHD, thoracic aortic 
aneurysm, MI status post CABG, afib, CHF, asthma, who presented 
with worsening dyspnea. 

#Dsypnea
Patient denies infectious symptoms, but does have a mild white 
count. D-dimer negative and patient has been compliant with 
xarelto. Trop negative. Patient doesn't appear to be volume up, 
and BNP mildly elevated to 900. CXR without evidence of volume 
overload. Echo with no new focal wall motion abnormalities. 
Patient was continued on home Advair, singulair, umeclidinium. 
Prednisone was increased to 30mg daily for a 5 day burst. The 
patient underwent a nuclear stress test which demonstrated 
"severe fixed defect in the inferior wall and moderate fixed 
defect in the apex is identified" which was consistent with her 
known cardiac disease and no inducible ischemia or wall motion 
abnormality. 
 
#CAD
No troponin elevation. No concerning EKG changes. Echo with no 
new focal wall motion abnormalities. Patient was continued on 
home aspirin and statin. Stress test negative as above.

IMAGING:
========

ECHO ___

The left atrial volume index is normal. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately 
depressed (LVEF = 35%) secondary to akinesis of the inferior 
free wall and hypokinesis of the inferior septum and posterior 
wall. The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right 
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall 
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and 
arch levels are normal. There is a mild coarctation of the 
distal aortic arch. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot 
be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened 
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. 
There is no pericardial effusion. 

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, 
the findings are similar; incidental note is made of a mild 
coarctation of the aorta.  

CXR ___
  
IMPRESSION:  
  
No new consolidation. No significant interval change since the 
prior chest radiograph. 
  
CXR ___

IMPRESSION:  
  
Retrocardiac atelectasis, but no focal consolidations to suggest 
pneumonia. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: ___ w/ JAK2-positive myeloproliferative 
disorder, AML s/p allogeneic HSCT (___), complicated by GVHD, 
including pulmonary GVHD, thoracic aortic aneurysm, MI status 
post CABG, afib, CHF, asthma, who presented with palpitations, 
found to have afib w/ rvr. 

ACUTE ISSUES:
=============
#Hypotension:
#Adrenal insufficiency: Resolved, noted for systolic in the mid 
___ on ___. Asymptomatic at the time. Her right arm 
cellulitis is improving. No evidence of bacteremia or evidence 
of acute bleeding. She is afebrile. She had negative growth in 
her urine and blood cultures. EKG C/w now with NSR since 
___. This hypotension may have been a combination of adrenal 
insufficiency (given low cortisol level, 0.3) and/or metoprolol 
side effect. She received x1 NS bolus with improvement. She has 
been normotensive for > 48 hours. Given concern for adrenal 
insufficiency, her prednisone dose was increased to 20mg daily 
on ___ (from 12.5mg daily). 

#Cellulitis: Improving. Exam of R arm concerning for cellulitis, 
at the site of the injury. There is no palpable fluid 
collection. Given patient's history of several antimicrobial 
allergies, she started on clindamycin for strep and staph 
coverage. As she has had C. diff in past (and tolerated PO 
vancomycin, but not metronidazole), she was also started for C. 
diff prophylaxis as she is on steroids as well [will continue 
until 1 week after clindamycin completion, ___. She 
was transitioned to PO clindamycin on ___ with plan for a 
2WK course [___]. She was initiated on close wound 
monitoring and daily dressing changes outpatient with her ___ to 
start on ___.

Past Medical History:
___ female with history of AML. She is status post 
allogeneic stem cell transplant from a sibling donor back in 
___. She is currently in disease remission. She has been 
monitored closely for chronic graft versus host disease of the 
skin and lungs. Her transplant course also has been complicated 
by a cardiac events. She has a hx of CAD s/p STEMI in ___ with 
DES in the RCA (___) and CABG (LIMA-LAD) (___), Was found to 
have two-vessel coronary artery disease with some stenosis as 
described above. She ultimately ended up having stents placed in 
her RCA, and she was also noted to have 98% blockage in her LAD 
in the mid area which was not initially addressed. She then 
underwent a second procedure with Dr. ___ to address this 
with a minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
with endoscopic takedown of her left internal mammary artery. 
This option was felt to be in her best interest given her severe 
allergic reaction to IV contrast dye. She also had an admission 
back in ___ for atrial fibrillation, and then had presented 
in ___ with acute abdominal pain, and was found to have 
diverticulitis with a perforated diverticulum. That course was 
complicated by an extended hospitalization with abdominal 
abscesses in the setting of abdominal surgery that she had for 
the ruptured diverticulum. In terms of her abdominal surgery, 
she did have a sigmoidectomy, ___ pouch and a colostomy. 
She did ultimately have this reversed in ___. She was found 
back in ___ to have a decline in her EF to 40-45% of 
unclear etiology. She continues to be followed closely by 
cardiology. Her ECHO was repeated in ___ and this was stable.
.
She also is followed by pulmonary. She has a history of gvhd of 
the lungs. She has had adjustments made to her steroids but has 
been on 10mg of Prednisone for a while now. In the late ___ she 
did have an exacerbation of her respiratory symptoms which was 
felt to be in part from gvhd as well as a respiratory infection. 
She did undergo pulmonary rehab. However, this ended a little 
early as her husband had a cardiac event around that time and 
she was going to his appointments. Some of her symptoms were 
also felt to be related in part to her cardiac history. Patient 
also missed her last appointment in ___ given what was

changes are not present.
.
Chest Radiograph (___): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic 
abnormality or significant change from the prior study.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old female with a past medical history significant for 
CAD s/p STEMI in ___ with DES in the RCA (___) and CABG 
(LIMA-LAD) (___), AML status post allogeneic transplant with 
pulmonary GVHD, GERD, who presents with abdominal discomfort and 
chills.
.
# Indigestion/GERD: Patient presented with atypical symptoms of 
abdominal indigestion and burping that were not suggestive of 
cardiac etiology, most likely secondary to underlying GERD.  
Patient reported that her discomfort was different in comparison 
to the symptoms experienced during her STEMI ___ years prior, 
which manifested primarily as epigastric discomfort.  Recent ETT 
on ___ was inconclusive without imaging.  Echo on ___ 
demonstrated mild reduction in her LVEF, that did not appear to 
be ischemic in nature.  Cardiac biomarkers were flat, ECG 
demonstrated non-specific ST changes in the setting of 
tachycardia.  Patient was continued on aspirin 81mg, beta 
blocker, lipitor, lisinopril.  She was continued on home PPi and 
started on simethicone for gas discomfort.  All symptoms 
resolved by the time of discharge.  Will follow up with primary 
care physician and cardiologist upon discharge, with potential 
stress test with imaging as an outpatient.
.
# Chills/Leukocytosis: Patient reported 30 minute history of 
shaking chills without fever prior to admission.  Remained 
afebrile throughout admission.  Leukocytosis was most likely 
secondary to hemoconcentration, as all cell lines normalized 
with IV fluids.  Blood culture was negative.  Urine analysis and 
culture were negative.  CXR with no acute cardiopulmonary 
process.
.
# Chronic dyspnea on exertion: Likely multifactorial, but per 
outpatient cardiologist, unlikely related to coronary 
insufficiency with exertion, as the inferior wall infarction is 
without significant viability within the adjacent areas to 
become ischemic.  Further, global reduction in ejection fraction 
was thought to be more consistent with toxic/metabolic etiology 
rather than ischemia.  Symptoms may be secondary to pulmonary 
GVHD, which is being treated by outpatient oncologist with 
steroids recently increased on ___. 
.
# AML status post allogeneic transplant: Stable, followed by Dr. 
___, with close follow up at the time of discharge.  Patient 
was continued on home acyclovir, home calcium/vit D, and 
alendronate every week.
.
# Chronic kidney disease: Creatinine at baseline.
.
# HTN: Normotensive, continued home metoprolol, lisinopril.
.
# Hypercholesterolemia: Continued home lipitor
.
# DMII: Metformin was held on admission, with initiation of 
insulin sliding scale.  Metformin restarted at the time of 
discharge.  
.
# Asthma: Stable, continued on home albuterol.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female w/ a hx of AML s/p alloSCT in 
___, in remission since, course c/b GVHD of skin, lung, and 
gut; CAD s/p 1v-CABG in ___, asthma (FEV1 40-45%), with recent 
exacerbation of lung GVHD, currently on Prednisone 20 mg PO QD 
with improvement in Sx, Afib on rivaroxiban and other issues 
presents to the ED with palpitations.

Last night she noted acute onset palpitations (HR in the 120s) 
around 1 am that woke her from sleep. She did not have chest 
pain or shortness of breath. She has since vomited 2x, once at 
home and once in the ED.  Her palpitations intermittently 
resolved but then worsened again. She denies recent 
fever/chills, cough/SOB, dysuria/hematuria, or preceding 
diarrhea. She does note having mutliple episodes of diarrhea. 
She reports adequate PO intake (eating more lately ___ 
steroids). 

In the ED, initial vital signs were:  96.3 85 124/56 18 96% RA 
she received Zofran with good relief for he nausea. 

Initially her HR was in the ___ and appeared to be sinus w/ 
frequent PACs; however, around 10:30a she was noted to be in 
Afib with RVR with rates in the 120s-130s, occasionally up to 
the 150s. SBP in the 100s (pt reports 110s normal for her), no 
chest pain or SOB. ECG 8:38a: Sinus arrhythmia, old Q waves 
inferolaterally, no new ST segment or T wave changes (TWIs in 
V1-V3 are old). ECG 10:28a: Afib w/ HR 150s, with ST depressions 
in V2-V4. CXR with no acute process. Cardiology was consulted 
and recommended rate control, increased metoprolol succinate 
from 25 mg PO QD to 50 mg PO QD, troponin was negative x2. 
While in the ED HR shot up to the 150s while having a bowel 
movement, then subsequently became bradycardic down to the ___ 
in sinus and became hypotensive to the ___ systolic. While 
patient was being assessed, her HR improved to the ___ and 
her BP recovered to the 120s. It was suspected this was a 
vasovagal episode (given bradycardia and hypotension) in the 
setting of a bowel movement. Non-con CT abd/pelvis was performed 
to rule out colitis given chronic steroid use and new diarrhea.

Exam was notable for NAD, irreg irreg, no abd tenderness, 
euvolemic.

Labs were notable for WBC 13, Cr of 1.4, TSH 4.9 troponins 
negative x2, UA - small bacteria and positivenitrites but no 
pyuria, given no Sx decision was made not to treat will not 
treat.

Patient was given

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo female w/ a hx of AML s/p alloSCT in 
___, in remission since, course c/b GVHD of skin, lung, and 
gut; CAD s/p 1v-CABG in ___, asthma (FEV1 40-45%), with recent 
exacerbation of lung GVHD, currently on Prednisone 20 mg PO QD 
with improvement in Sx, Afib on rivaroxiban and other issues 
presented to the ED with palpitations, nausea, diarrhea and UTI. 
Patient started on IV fluids, unasyn (given multiple allergies 
to other antibiotics) and increased her metoprolol. She sinus 
converted without intervention and her electrolytes improved 
significantly with aggressive IVF resuscitation and electrolyte 
repletion. The patient was continued on unasyn for 5 days with 
complete resolution of chills and fevers. The patient was found 
to have a IgG level less than 400 and given an infusion of IgG. 
She had a mild reaction to the IgG after completion, which 
resolved with hydrocortisone, benadryl and lasix. The patient's 
diarrhea resolved prior to discharge and all bacterial studies 
were negative. The patient was discharged home on her home 
medications with instructions to continue oral rehydration after 
discharge. The patient will follow up with Dr. ___ 
after discharge and is scheduled for a visit on ___. 

ACUTE ISSUES

# Gastroenteritis- Patient presented with symptoms of nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea. She had denied any fevers or chills, or 
SOB prior to coming to the hospital.  Her biggest concern was 
the palpitations. She was evaluated by Oncology and cardiology 
in the ED for her a.fib with RVR (see below) decision was made 
to admit her to medicine. In the ED CT scan was negative for 
colitis. On arrival to the floor patient continued to have loose 
stools. Stool studies were sent and showed no signs of bacterial 
infection. Rotavirus was pending at discharge. C.diff was 
negative. Given her history of GVHD there was some concern of it 
recurring however CT scan was reassuring as there was no sign of 
colitis. It was suspected that the patient was suffering from 
viral gastroenteritis, however she spiked the fever on hospital 
day 1 to 102, and was subsequently started on IV unasyn. Given 
her medical history and illness the decision was made to 
transfer her to the bone marrow transplant service. The 
patient's diarrhea improved with supportive care after multiple 
days in the hospital. After bacterial studies returned negative 
and patient finished 5 day course, Unasyn was stopped. Rotavirus 
was pending at discharge.  

#Urinary Tract Infection- Patient had a urinary analysis in the 
ED that was concerning for nitrites and a few bacteria, she did 
not have particular symptoms that were concerning. However given 
her immunosuppression urine culture was sent and was positive 
for pan-sensitive E.coli. She was empirically started on IV 
unasyn (after discussion with pharmacy and infectious disease) 
given her multiple drug allergies. She completed 5 day course of 
unasyn and given no evidence of complicated UTI was not 
transitioned to oral antibiotics. 

# Atrial fibrillation- Patient has a history of atrial 
fibrillation. In the emergency department she was found to be in 
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, likely the 
cause of her palpitations. She was evaluated by cardiology in 
the ED and her home metoprolol increased from 25mg daily to 50mg 
daily. She was hemodynamically stable apart from the vasovagal 
hypotensive episode likely due to bowel movement. Patient 
stabilized and was also continued on rivaraoxiban 20mg daily. 
Patient sinus converted spontaneously in the hospital. At time 
of discharge the patient was returned onto her home dose of 
metoprolol given RVR was likely in the setting of infection. The 
patient had no recurrent runs of RVR throughout hospitalization. 


# Hx of AML s/p BMT complicated by GVHD of lung and skin: 
Patient was continued on  prednisone 20mg daily,  acyclovir, 
azithromycin and atovaquone for prophylasxis. She was continued 
on spireva, advair and albuterol for her Hx of lung GVHD. 

#Acute on chronic CKD (baseline 1.2)- Patient presented with a 
creatinine elevated to 1.4. It was suspected to be due to 
pre-renal etiology given her diarrhea and limited PO intake. The 
patient was given IVF fluid boluses and encouraged PO intake. 
The patients creatinine down trended to 0.9. Her lisinopril was 
held in the setting of acute kidney injury and restarted on 
discharge. 

CHRONIC ISSUES

# DM2 - controlled on oral medications as outpatient, Held home 
meds and started on SSI.

#CAD with hx of STEMI: patient  was stable and continued on 
aspirin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. Lisinopril was held in 
the setting of ___.

___ Transthoracic echocardiogram:
CONCLUSION:
The left atrial volume index is mildly increased. The right 
atrium is mildly enlarged. There is no evidence for an atrial 
septal defect by 2D/color Doppler. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with a normal cavity size. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the 
inferoseptum, inferior, and inferolateral walls (see schematic) 
and preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. No 
thrombus or mass is seen in the left ventricle. Quantitative 
biplane left ventricular ejection fraction is 42 %. There is no 
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular 
septal defect is seen. Normal right ventricular cavity size with 
mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with normal 
ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is 
normal. There is a significant flow acceleration in the proximal 
descending thoracic aorta,
consistent with stenosis in the descending aorta. (peak gradient 
25mmHg /mean gradient 18mmHg ). A possible type A/ascending 
aortic dissection is seen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are 
mildly thickened. A
moderate (0.6 x 0.2 cm) echodensity is seen on the aortic side 
of the aortic valve most c/w a Lambl's excrescence (cannot 
exclude a vegetation if clinically suggested). There is no 
aortic valve stenosis. There is
mild [1+] aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse.
There is an eccentric, inferolateral directed jet of mild to 
moderate [___] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets appear structurally normal. There is mild [1+] 
tricuspid regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure 
could not be estimated. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Possible Type A aortic dissection. Moderate sized 
mass attached to the coaptation point of the aortic valve 
leaflets most consistent with a Lambl's excrescence. Mild 
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size 
and mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD in an RCA 
distribution. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Acceleration of 
flow in the descending aorta consistent with stenosis.

___ Trans esophageal Echo:

Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:   45%   >= 55%   
  
Findings   
Limited TEE exam to rule out Ascending aortic dissection. Exam 
done with Dr. ___.   
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. 

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal 
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. 

AORTIC VALVE: No AS. Trace AR. 

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) 
MR. 

___ VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet. 
No PS. Physiologic PR. 

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion. 

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the 
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the 
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results 
were personally reviewed with the MD caring for the patient.   
Conclusions   
 Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. 
Dr. ___ was notified in person of the results.
 The descending thoracic aorta is seen and not does not show any 
dissection. Distal ascending aorta and proximal arch not 
visualized.

Discharge Instructions:
 WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL? 
 ========================== 
 - You were admitted because your primary care doctor thought he 
identified a new heart murmur and we were concerned that there 
was a problem with the blood flow around your heart called an 
aortic dissection.

 WHAT HAPPENED IN THE HOSPITAL? 
 ============================== 
 - We preformed an echocardiogram which was inconclusive 
 - We therefore did a trans esophageal echocardiogram under 
general anesthesia that did not show a dissection.

 WHAT SHOULD I DO WHEN I GO HOME? 
 ================================ 
 - Take all of your medications as prescribed without changes. 
 - Follow up with your doctors including ___ your primary 
care appointment to be seen within 10 days. You will ___ 
with Dr. ___ as scheduled. If you have any symptoms between 
now and that appointment that are concerning, please call the

Ms. ___ is a ___ female with AML s/p alloSCT in 
___ complicated by pulmonary GVHD, secondary JAK2+ 
myeloproliferative disease/essential thrombocytosis on hydrea, 
thoracic aneurysm s/p stent graft ___, asthma, paroxysmal atrial 
fibrillation on Xarelto, MI s/p CABG, adrenal insufficiency on 
prednisone, DMII, HFrEF (LVEF 42% ___, and vertebral 
fractures s/p kyphoplasty. She presented with weakness, fever, 
and worsening shortness of breath . Admitted for likely PNA vs. 
worsening GVHD.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
====================
Discharge weight: 57.52 kg - 126.8 lbs
Discharge Cr: 1.0
Discharge Hgb: 9.2
Discharge ANC: 2.28
Discharge platelets: 81

[ ] Follow-up with Dr. ___ ___ - will arrange sooner 
follow-up with NP
[ ] Follow-up cell counts to consider need for repeat bone 
marrow biopsy
[ ] Consider restarting hydroxyurea, which was held while 
inpatient in the setting of pancytopenia
[ ] Consider restarting lisinopril which was held while 
inpatient due to soft blood pressure
[ ] Recheck thyroid function tests given finding of slightly 
high TSH with normal free T4

ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES ADDRESSED
=================================
# Fever / SOB
# Pneumonia 
# ? Worsening Pulmonary GVHD
Patient presented with fever, weakness, worsening shortness of 
breath and cough. Unclear etiology given CXR, UA, and flu swab 
negative. She had documented fever to 101.4 in the ED. Her RVP 
was negative but CT chest reported possible pneumonia. 
Additional concern for worsening GVHD in setting of recent 
decreased dose of prednisone. Patient received full course of 
antibiotic for pneumonia (piperacillin/tazobactam). Additionally 
steroid dosing was increased temporarily in the setting of 
worsening SOB, fevers and known secondary adrenal insufficiency. 
Throughot admission shortness of breath and cough improved 
significantly and therefore we restarted steroid taper.

# Secondary adrenal insufficiency
Given patient's history of secondary adrenal insufficiency and 
fever as above with need for 3L NS for normalization of lactate 
in setting of recent decreased prednisone dose, we tripled the 
patient's prednisone dose to 30 mg daily. Prior to discharge we 
restarted steroid taper which was tolerated with no new 
symptoms.

#Pancytopenia 
Pt with worsening pancytopenia on presentation which was 
different from her baseline. Plan was for bone marrow biopsy on 
___ but counts remained stable and uptrended slightly 
throughout admission. Bone marrow biopsy was deferred but as a 
transitional issue patient needs to follow blood cell count 
trends to determine the need for repeat bone marrow biopsy.

# JAK2-Positive Myeloproliferative Disorder
# AML s/p Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant complicated by 
Pulmonary GVHD
Patient admitted with pancytopenia as above and therefore 
hydroxyurea was held. Prednisone dose was also increased as 
detailed above. She was continue on her home acyclovir, Advair, 
Montelukast.

CHRONIC ISSUES PERTINENT TO ADMISSION

# CAD s/p CABG
# Chronic HFrEF (LVEF 42% ___
# Mild MR
- Patient continued on home ASA, Lipitor, metoprolol, and 
lisinopril

# DMII: In setting of chronic steroid use.
- Held home metformin and managed with ISS while inpatient

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation
- Patient continued on home metoprolol and rivaroxaban
- One dose of rivaroxaban was held in anticipation of bone 
marrow biopsy but was restarted soon after decision to defer.

# Hypothyroidism
___ checked and found to be slightly high with normal free T4
- Patient continued on home levothyroxine

# Anxiety
- Patient continued on home Ativan PRN

# GERD
- Patient continued on home dexlansoprazole as non-formulary

Discharge Instructions:
Dear ___,  

It was a privilege taking care of you at ___ 
___.  

WHY WAS I IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- You were admitted because you were having fevers and increased 
shortness of breath and cough

WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE HOSPITAL?  
- We investigated the different possible causes for your fever. 
- We believe the fever and shortness of breath were most likely 
caused by a pneumonia that initially was a viral infection and 
could have been superinfected by a bacteria.
- Also as you had history of pulmonary graft versus host 
disease, we increased your prednisone temporarily to cover the 
possibility of GVHD flare.
- Initially your blood counts were dropping and this initially 
made us consider that you could need a bone marrow biopsy. 
However, your blood counts recovered while getting the treatment 
for pneumonia and biopsy was not necessary.
- You successfully finished the antibiotic course for the 
pneumonia

WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER I LEAVE THE HOSPITAL?  
- Continue to take all your medicines and keep your 
appointments.  

We wish you the best.

Sincerely,  
Your ___ Team

slightly more apparent and the other findings are similar.
.
___ EKG: Rate 128, Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular 
response. Leftward axis. Inferior myocardial infarction, age 
undetermined. There is somewhat early R wave progression. ST-T 
wave abnormalities in the precordial leads. Since the previous

.
___ EKG : rate 58-60, Baseline artifact. Sinus bradycardia. 
Inferior wall myocardial infarction. ST-T wave abnormalities. 
Since the previous tracing of ___ atrial fibrillation with 
rapid ventricular response is no longer seen. 
.

ADDITIONAL IMAGING STUDIES:
___ CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:
1. Small amount of pneumoperitoneum anteriorly and also around 
the liver.
Small pelvic free fluid also tracking up along the right 
paracolic gutter.
Extensive colonic diverticulosis, with mild stranding 
surrounding a loop of
sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant suggesting sigmoid 
diverticulitis as possible source for perforation. The appendix 
appears normal throughout its length.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Atherosclerotic disease.
.
.
___ PORTABLE CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is 
unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There is no free air under 
the diaphragm. There is stable deformity of one of the right 
ribs, likely related to old trauma or surgical intervention. 
CONCLUSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process. No air under the 
diaphragm.

.
___ CXR : New right picc line with tip in proximal svc. 
Intraperitoneal air remains, possibly with slight increase vs 
redistribution. Minimal retrocardiac opacity c/w atelectasis 
however minimal infectious vs inflammatory process cannot be 
excluded. 
.

___ CT ABD/PELVIS W/O CONTRAST FINDINGS:
Visualized portions of the lung bases are unchanged from the 
previous study. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. 
Coronary arterial calcification is also noted. A moderate-sized 
pneumoperitoneum is enlarged since ___. A small amount of 
free-fluid is also seen, predominantly in a perihepatic location 
as well as a second collection at the base of the mesentery 
(2:49). The unenhanced liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands 
and kidneys are unremarkable. Note is made of a gallstone within 
an otherwise unremarkable gallbladder, unchanged. 
Atherosclerotic calcification is noted along the abdominal aorta 
and its arterial branches and note is also made of aortic 
ectasia. Scattered mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes 
are visualized, none of which meet CT criteria for pathologic 
enlargement.
The previously described area of thickening along the sigmoid 
colon in the
area of known diverticulosis is again visualized, and there is 
also
extraluminal leak of oral contrast. This extraluminal contrast 
accumulates
predominantly in the pelvis, near the sigmoid colon. This 
finding along with the enlarging pneumoperitoneum is indicative 
of a perforation, likely
at the sigmoid colon.
A Foley catheter is seen within an otherwise normal urinary 
bladder. The
uterus and rectum are unremarkable. There is no pelvic or 
inguinal
lymphadenopathy.
OSSEOUS FINDINGS: Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the
thoracolumbar spine are unchanged. No suspicious sclerotic or 
lytic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. Pneumoperitoneum, larger since ___ ___s 
extraluminal leak of
oral contrast, collecting near the sigmoid colon. Overall, these 
findings are concerning for a perforated sigmoid diverticulum.
2. Unchanged cholelithiasis.
3. Atherosclerotic disease.
.
___ CT CHEST :
FINDINGS: The previously seen scattered ground-glass opacities, 
predominantly within the right lung have resolved. However, new 
focal opacities, to a much lesser extent than previous, are seen 
within the right upper lobe in the azygoesophageal recess and 
along the medial anterior right lower lobe abutting the fissure 
and mediastinum (5:180). There is diffuse acute dilatation of 
the airways with several areas of mucoid impaction as well as 
bronchial wall thickening bilaterally. There are no discrete 
pulmonary nodules. There are small bilateral pleural effusions, 
left greater than right, the left has slightly increased in size 
since ___. There is no pericardial effusion or 
lymphadenopathy. A new right main coronary artery stent has been 
placed.
This examination was not tailored for subdiaphragmatic 
evaluation. Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate new 
ascites. Layering gallstones are noted. The remainder of the 
upper abdomen is unremarkable.
There is extensive worsened anasarca.
There are no osseous lesions suspicious for malignancy.
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute airway infection with associated focal parenchymal 
involvement.
2. Previous extensive ground-glass opacity has nearly resolved.
3. New ascites.
4. Stable little-sized aortic pseudoaneurysm incompletely 
evaluated without IV contrast.
5. Small bilateral pleural effusions with the left, slightly 
increased. 
.
.
___ PA ans LAT CXR: PA and lateral upright chest radiograph 
were compared to ___ and chest CT from ___.
The left PICC line tip is at the junction of brachiocephalic 
vein and SVC. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. The 
lungs are essentially clear
except for linear atelectasis at the lingula. Bilateral left 
more than right pleural effusions are grossly unchanged. Right 
coronary artery is stented.
.
.
___ CT ABD AND PELVIS: IMPRESSION:
1. Large, likely multiloculated fluid collection extending from 
the pelvis
adjacent to the surgical chain sutures into the lower left 
abdomen. Given
patient's clinical symptoms superinfection is suspected. 
Portions of the
fluid collection do appear amenable to percutaneous 
aspiration/drainage.
2. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute 
diverticulitis. No
findings to suggest bowel obstruction, although oral contrast 
has not yet
progressed through the entire remaining large bowel.
3. Interval development of small simple left pleural effusion 
with adjacent
compressive atelectasis.
4. Unchanged cholelithiasis without secondary findings to 
suggest acute
cholecystitis.
.
.
___ CT-GUIDED PELVIC ABSCESS DRAINAGE
HISTORY: ___ patient with colostomy for perforated 
diverticulitis.
CT scan from yesterday showed a left pericolic abscess. Catheter 
drainage of the abscess was requested. PROCEDURE: Procedure and 
its complications were explained. Informed consent obtained. 
Laboratory values checked, INR was initially elevated, fresh 
frozen plasma was used to lower this to 1.5. The patient is also 
on aspirin and Plavix, which could not be discontinued because 
of the cardiac considerations. It was decided to proceed with 
the CT-guided abscess drainage. Timeout was performed. Area of 
interest was localized under CT fluoroscopy. The skin was 
prepped and draped in the usual manner. 1% lidocaine used for 
local anesthetic. Conscious sedation was also used. Under CT 
fluoroscopic guidance, a 10 ___ ___ catheter was placed 
in the left pericolic abscess. Approximately 30 cc of thick pus 
were aspirated. Specimen has been sent for microbiology and cell 
count. Patient tolerated the procedure well. 
CONCLUSION: Successful placement of 10 ___ pigtail catheter 
in the left
pericolic abscess. Tube left to JP bulb suction. No obvious 
complications at the time of the procedure.

.
___ CT ABD & PELVIS W/OUT CONTRAST: IMPRESSION:
1. Slight interval decrease in size of a left flank and pelvic 
collection
with pigtail catheter in place in unchanged position. No 
interval change in
size of smaller possibly separate collection in the right flank.
2. Opacification of the ___ pouch shows no evidence of 
contrast leakage into the adjacent fluid collection.
3. Diverting colonostomy with diverticulosis of the most distal 
segment of

Brief Hospital Course:
.
#Abdominal Pain:  Mrs. ___ was admitted for lower quadrant 
crampy abdominal pains. The patient was considered a high-risk 
operative candidate due to her cardiac and cancer history, and 
her pain was focal and isolated to her right lower quadrent, and 
thus initially received conservative treatment. CT of 
abdomen/pelvis at time of admission had showed small amount of 
pneumoperitoneum anteriorly and also around the liver. Small 
pelvic free fluid also tracking
up along the right paracolic gutter. Extensive colonic 
diverticulosis, with mild stranding surrounding a loop of 
sigmoid colon in the left lower quadrant suggesting sigmoid 
diverticulitis as possible source for perforation. 

She was started on Zosyn early on in her hospital course. Though 
she initially responded quite well to the IV antibiotics with 
significant improvement in her abdominal pain for the first ___ 
days, he patient's abdominal pain & overall appearance worsened 
on hospital day #4, and it was clear that she needed to be taken 
to the operating room for a exploratory laparotomy. Repeat 
imaging confirmed perforated sigmoid diverticulum.   She was 
given FFP, Vitamoin K to correct her INR of 8, and 1 unit of 
PRBC and taken to the operating room. In the O.R. the surgical 
team found a thickened indurated colon but no masses. There was 
an extensive area of inflammatory changes with a small area of 
focal perforation along sigmoid colon. There was contained stool 
in the pelvis. She underwent surgery for a perforated 
diverticulum including a sigmoidectomy, ___ pouch, and 
colostomy with a plan for anastamosis in the future. Her 
operative course was relatively uncomplicated, she did have some 
intra-op bleeding which was managed with cautery and FFP. 

Her post-op course was later complicated by fever after being 
taken off Zosyn (her zosyn was continued post operatively for 
PNA treatment). On CT of the abdomen she was found to have 
loculated fluid collections which required post-operative ___ 
drainage and a JP drain was left in place. She then had to go 
for repeat ___ drainage to help break up the loculations. For 
enteric broad coverage she was started on Zosyn, Vancomycin, 
Caspofungin, and Gentamicin and her abdominal fluid grew 
pseudomonas which was fortunately sensitive to multiple agents. 
As she continued to recover steadily she was gradually taken off 
of Vancomycin, Caspofungin and Gentamicin but continued on 
Zosyn. 
.
A repeat CT was done on ___ to assess interval changes and it 
appeared that there was continued decrease in size of the left 
flank and pelvic collections, ___ pouch showed no evidence 
of leak, and she also had complete resolution of bilateral mild 
hydronephrosis. After this reassuring CT study the surgical team 
removed her one remaining JP drain on her left abdomen. 
Colostomy site and prior JP entry site were clean, dry, 
non-edematous, non-erythematous and in tact at time of 
discharge. She was set-up with home line care services for her 
PICC line and she was also set up for additional home ___ 
services at time of discharge. She had no signs of fevers, 
abdominal pains, leukocytosis or discomfort for several days 
leading up to her discharge date. She was instructed to continue 
her daily Zosyn coverage up until her follow up surgery 
outpatient appointment at the end of ___ with Dr. ___.  
A repeat CT was set-up a few days prior to this appointment to 
allow for final review for any recurrent abscesses or 
collections prior to final removal of PICC and antibiotic 
discontinuance. 
.

# History of AML: The patient's hematologic/oncology history 
dates back to ___ after routine labs indicated persistent 
pancytopenia. She had an initial bone marrow biopsy with 
myelodysplasia with no cytogenetic abnormalities and additional 
workup that was most consistent with MDS. ___ vitamin B12 
deficiency was also diagnosed during her initial Heme/Oncology 
work-up. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed acute 
erythroleukemia and she was diagnosed with AML. She was admitted 
___ for induction chemotherapy with 7+3 cytarabine and 
idarubicin, which she tolerated well. She underwent allogeneic 
transplantation from an HLA matched sibling donor with 
pentostatin/TBI in ___. She had additional note of 
subsequent mild GVHD, predominantly over her skin and mouth. At 
time of this current admission she had been doing well from an 
oncologic standpoint and she was on 3mg daily Prednisone, and a 
prophylactic dose of acyclovir 400mg PO TID. During this 
admission she was given her inhaled pentamidine on ___. Upon 
discharge, Mrs. ___ was set up for close follow-up appointment 
with Dr. ___ primary oncologist. 
.
# Anemia: The patient developed anemia while in the hospital but 
it remained stable. Iron studies showed that she was not iron 
deficient. As aforementioned she had a vitamin B12 deficiency 
recognized back in ___ during her initial referral visits to 
the hematology/oncology service for pancytopenia. Her B12 shot 
was given on ___ during this hospital stay. She did require 
blood transfusions during her hospitalization both 
___ and after her ___ drainage. She tolerated these 
very well with no significant reactions of note. Hematocrit at 
admission was 43 and she had nadir to ___ range and by time of 
discharge her hematocrit was back to ___ range consistently 
and she had no signs of any active bleeding.  
.
# Hypoxia: Post operatively Mrs. ___ became hypoxic with an 
oxygen requirement.  She was found to have a positive RSV 
respiratory study ___. A CT from ___ showed new focal 
opacities in the RUL. She also had diffuse acute dilatation of 
the airways with mucoid impaction and bronchial wall thickening 
bilaterally. She had slightly increased pleural effusions and 
her ground-glass opacity has mostly resolved. Her oxygen 
requirement resolved on ___. Per surgical team notes she ahd 
been placed on Zosyn prior to her surgery and after being 
diagnosed with probable RUL PNA her therapy was prolonged per ID 
recommendations, particularly  given her additional abdominal 
collections (alongside Gentamicin). She was placed on albuterol 
nebulizers and inhalers which she continued to use with 
decreasing frequency as her breathing came back to baseline.  
Blood cultures during her hospitalization were all negative. 
Given her PMH of mild asthma she was discharged to continue her 
usual home albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis and to notify 
her doctor if she had any additional fevers, productive cough or 
recurrent dyspnea. 
.
# Coronary Artery Disease:  Mrs. ___ had history of CAD with 
prior inferior STEMI in ___ for which she underwent RCA 
stenting, and later had an endoscopic CABG x1. She was continued 
on her usual Plavix, aspirin, and atorvastatin therapy. She was 
set up for ___ follow up appointment with Dr. ___ 
discharge. 
.
#Hypertension: Metoprolol dose was decreased to metoprolol 
tartrate 12.5 BID as her blood pressure well controlled on this 
regimen and she was bradycardic at night when on a higher dose. 
Normotensive at time of discharge.   
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Mrs. ___ and 
post-operative course were complicated by atrial fibrillation. 
Before her laparotomy, she was evaluated by cardiology and her 
coumadin therapy she had been taking for her known atrial 
fibrillation was discontinued for the procedure. She had some 
rapid bouts of atrial fibrillation on ___ which required a 
diltiazem drip for control. On ___ she was taken to the O.R. 
with no significant cardiac events. Post-surgery she was 
monitored with serial EKGs, and continuous telemetry and she was 
eventually converted back to NSR with Amiodarone therapy. She 
was restarted on warfarin after her surgery and she continued 
metoprolol. After discussion with Dr. ___ warfarin was 
discontinued and she had her dose of Amiodarone tapered prior to 
discharge. She will see discuss length of her treatment and 
further dose adjustments at her upcoming cardiology follow-up 
appointment. She was discharged on 400mg Amiodarone BID. 
.
# Hypotension: She experienced hypotension preoperatively that 
required fluid boluses.  She also experienced hypotension post 
operatively that was asymptomatic.  Post operatively her 
hypotensive episodes were attributed to the combination of 
getting metoprolol and lasix per the surgical service notes. By 
the time she was transferred to the ___ service on 
post-operative day nine she was predominantly normotensive and 
she remained stable for the remainder of her hospital stay. 
.
# Edema: The patient had extensive lower extremity edema and 
less prominent upper extremity edema post-operatively. She was 
diuresed aggressively with lasix.  She then auto-diuresed for 
several days without the use of lasix. By the time of her 
transfer to the ___ service her swelling was minimal although 
still present. She ws seen by the physical therapy team and was 
able to ambulate and do some minimal exercises which markedly 
helped with her conditioning and edema collections. By time of 
discharge she was near to her usual baseline and she was not 
placed on any additional diuretics at discharge.
.
# GERD: She has a history of gastroesophageal reflux and she was 
continued on her usual famotidine medication for GI protection 
and relief during her stay.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus Type II: –Mrs. ___ is normally 
exercise and diet controlled. She was placed on an additional 
insulin sliding scale for tight control in the ___ 
setting and while in the hospital. She had well controlled 
fasting and prandial fingersticks which required minimal to no 
SSI coverage. At time of discharge, she was therefore not placed 
on any additional agents.
.
# Insomnia: She had some mild complaints of occasional insomnia 
during her hospital course which was effectively relieved with 
lorazepam 0.5 mg PO HS:PRN.   
.
# Nutrition /electrolytes: She required TPN post-operatively but 
was then transitioned to a regular diabetic diet which she 
tolerated very well. No issues with colostomy training and care. 
Nutrition helped with initial electrolyte balance and she was 
repleted as needed during her stay with close daily monitoring 
of all of her electrolytes.     
.
# Elevated LFTs: Mrs. ___ had some ___ noted during 
her hospital course  which was thought to be secondary to her 
antibiotics. Once she was tapered down to just Zosyn she seemed 
to have a resolution of these abnormal labs.  At the time of 
discharge her LFTs were back to normal ranges with AST 39, ALT 
33, ALP 82, LDH 199,  and total bilirubin 0.4. 
.
#Code Status: The patient was maintained as a full code status 
for the entirety of her hospital course.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of JAK2+ 
myeloproliferative disorder, AML s/p alloHSCT in ___ c/b GVHD 
(pulmonary) on prednisone, MI s/p CABG, atrial fibrillation, 
HFrEF (EF 35%), and thoracic aortic aneurysm who presents with 
diarrhea.

# Diarrhea: Differential included infectious (C. diff, bacterial 
or viral gastroenteritis) vs. diverticulitis vs. less likely 
GVHD. She had benign abdominal exam and did not have abdominal 
imaging. She was given fluids and her metformin was held on 
admission. Diarrhea improved and she was able to tolerate 
regular diet without issue. Her lactate was initially elevated 
but improved with fluid likely d/t hypovolemia iso diarrhea. 
Initially felt she was high risk for C diff given recent 
antibiotics but was on vancomycin prophylaxis. C diff was 
negative, noro negative. Stool culture and O&P pending at time 
of discharge. Felt that her symptoms were most likely due to 
side effect of metformin. Per patient she may have had similar 
side-effect years before on higher doses of metformin. Patient 
should NOT increase metformin higher than 500mg BID in the 
future. 

# JAK2-Positive Myeloproliferative Disorder
# AML s/p Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant complicated by GVHD: 
Home acyclovir and hydrea, prednisone, and azithromycin and 
pulmonary medications were continued without issue. 

# CAD
# Systolic CHF: home asa, statin, and metoprolol were continued 

# T2DM: Home metformin was held during admission. She was 
discharged on reduced dose as likely higher dose causing 
presenting symptoms. She will follow up with PCP for management 
of medications. 

# Atrial Fibrillation: 
- Continue on metoprolol (will fractionate to 25mg BID)
- Continue home rivaroxaban

# Hypothyroidism
- Continue home levothyroxine

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
================================= 
- New Meds: none 
- Stopped/Held Meds: none 
- Changed Meds: Metformin dose reduced to 500mg BID 
[] Follow up blood sugar control 
[] Consider adding additional medication for blood sugar 
control. 
[] Patient should NOT be on doses of metformin greater than 
500mg BID 
[] Consider starting ACE ___ for HFrEF

recommended continuing her home prednisone dose. Low suspicion
for asthma exacerbation in the absence of wheezing; home Advair
and montelukast were continued and home Incruse was held in
hospital and resumed on discharge. Cardiac etiology also thought
unlikely as below. Her mild, persistent dyspnea on exertion at
the time of discharge was attributed to resolving PNA and
deconditioning. Given her reassuring vital signs, she was

triggered for afib w/RVR, likely secondary to resolving sepsis.
EKG showed anterolateral ST depressions, likely rate-related
strain, with low suspicion for ACS in absence of chest pain and
with negative troponins x 2. TSH WNL. Rates were controlled with
resumption of home Metoprolol, and she converted back to NSR
prior to discharge. Seen by cardiology, who recommended
continuation of her home Toprol 50mg daily. Home Xarelto 20mg
daily was continued throughout her hospitalization. ___ with her

cardiology. Developed Afib w/RVR ___epressions on EKG, likely rate-related strain with low 
suspicion
for ACS per cardiology given absence of chest pain and negative
cardiac biomarkers. Repeat EKG after conversion to NSR showed
resolution of inferior ST depressions but persistent pre-cordial
TWI, likely memory T-waves and less concerning for ___ per
cardiology. Home ASA and lipitor were continued and home
Metoprolol was resumed as above. No e/o volume overload, and
weight on discharge 129 lbs, consistent with her dry weight. 
Home
lisinopril held for borderline ___, as below. ___ with her
outpatient cardiologist (Dr. ___ scheduled for ___.
