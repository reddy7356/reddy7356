Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopedic surgery service and

Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The 
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the 
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

pain medications.  The patient received Xarelto 10 mg daily for 
DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.  The surgical 
dressing will remain on until POD#7 after surgery.  The patient

the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of 
discharge the patient was tolerating a regular diet and feeling 
well.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.  The 
patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately 
controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was 
neurovascularly intact and the dressing was intact.
