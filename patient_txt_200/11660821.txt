IMAGING:
CT Neck ___
IMPRESSION: 4.2 x 3.6 x and 4.6 cm cystic structure which 
appears to arise 
Preliminary Reportfrom the inferior portion of the right lobe of 
the thyroid gland causing 
Preliminary Reportleftward deviation and mass effect on the 
trachea and esophagus. Differential 
Preliminary Reportdiagnosis includes fourth branchial cleft cyst 
and/or thryoglossal duct cyst, 
Preliminary Reportalthough less likely. Superinfection however 
cannot be excluded. 

Ultrasound Thyroid
IMPRESSION: 
1.  Large heterogeneous cyst in the right thyroid lobe with 
internal echoes, compatible with blood clot.  This was targeted 
for ultrasound guided 
aspiration.  
2.  Left upper pole 1.4 cm peripherally calcified nodule.  
Correlation with outside hospital prior imaging is recommended 
to document stability. 

Ultrasound Thyroid Post FNA
IMPRESSION: 
Preliminary ReportSuccessful aspiration of the right thyroid 
hemorrhagic cyst yielding, Preliminary Reportcompatible with a 
hemorrhagic cyst. A sample was sent for culture and Gram 
Preliminary Reportstain.  
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo F w/ hx of HTN and multinodular goiter p/w rapidly growing 
R-sided neck mass found to be cystic and hemorrhagic. 

#Neck mass: 
-Patient was on vacation to ___ and began to notice 
swelling on the right side of neck which increased over the 
course of 5 days, especially during the two days prior to 
admission. She decided to seek medical care after noting pain on 
swallowing, but had no dysphagia or difficulty breathing. She 
was seen at ___ where a CT scan showed 6cm large 
cystic R neck mass compressing the trachea and esophagus with 
tracheal deviation. She received IV antibiotics prior to 
transfer to ___. Pt was seen by ENT, thoracic surgery, and 
endocrinology; started IV dexamethasone and 
ampicillin-sulbactam; and admitted to the medical intensive care 
unit out of concern for possible airway compromise. Given prior 
history of multinodular goiter and time scale of swelling, most 
likely hemorrhagic vs. infectious with aspirate and imaging 
consistent with hemorrhage. Differential diagnosis also includes 
ectopic thyroid, degenerating thyroid adenoma, thyroglossal duct 
cyst, branchial cleft cyst. Malignancy is less likely as mass is 
completely cystic and drainage nonserous though this is a 
possibility. TSH was normal. Swelling and discomfort improved 
with abx and steroids. She had mass drained by interventional 
radiology while in MICU with 35cc bloody drainage and has been 
stable. She denies any other sx such as fever/chills, n/v/d, 
difficulty breathing during development of cyst or currently.  
___ virus studies, blood cultures and fluid 
cultures/cell count/hematocrit were pending as of discharge. 
Gram stain of fluid was negative for polymorphonuclear 
leukocytes or microorganisms. Patient was converted to 
amoxicillin-clavulanate on arrival to floor for ___nd 
discharged with above abx in addition to 2 day course of oral 
prednisone to help protect against further swelling during 
travel back to ___. 

#Hyperglycemia
-Patient has no history of elevated blood sugar but has had 
fingerstick blood glucos to the 200s after steroid 
administration. She was treated with insulin sliding scale while 
in house.  

#HTN
-Stable during admission while home bendroflumethiazide was 
held. She should restart this medication when she returns home. 

Transitional Issues:
-Patient has had elevated blood sugars after steroids during 
this admission. This should be followed up on return to ___ 
with GP. 
-Patient has another cyst/nodule on left side of neck. Imaging 
should be compared to prior imaging to see if this nodule is 
stable. 
-Patient will require workup of the nodule to determine its 
etiology. She is being discharged with her records from this 
admission. We have taken her contact information, that of her 
GP, and have registered her for ___ Patientsite so that she 
can find her lab studies and imaging reports online. She was 
also provided with the business card and email address of the 
internal medicine intern managing her care.  
-studies on the fluid drained from the cyst are still pending at 
the time of discharge. Pt signed up for web access to our system 
and her email address is in our system to give her the results. 
Also her GP's information was obtained
