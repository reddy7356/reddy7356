Reports

ECG
Sinus arrhythmia at lower limits of normal rate. No previous 
tracing available for comparison. There is considerable 
artifact. Consider repeat tracing if clinically indicated. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: ___ y/o F with PMHx of SVT s/p ablation, HTN, asthma 
who presented for recurrent pre-syncopal episodes for 2 weeks 
duration thought to be due to anxiety

#Pre-syncopal episodes- Initial concerns were for recurrent SVT 
vs. new arrhythmia vs. structural heart disease (i.e atrial 
myxoma) vs. hyperthyroidism vs. vs. anxiety vs. autonomic 
instability vs. orthostasis. Her symptomatology was quite 
different than her presentation ___ years prior per record review. 
She does not feel palpitations and is at a normal rate, which 
makes structural disease somewhat more likely. Patient was 
placed on telemetry overnight, which did not reveal SVT but 
confirmed sinus arrhythmia.  Echocardiography was considered, 
but give no murmer, unremarkable ECG, and lack of family 
history, this was deferred.  Orthostatics were negative.  
Laboratory workup was negative for anemia or thyroid disease.  
Her history was remarkable for significant stressors, including 
losing her home and going through a divorce.  We offered her 
social work consult but she politely declined.  Stated she will 
seek counsel through recommendations with her PCP.  She was also 
discharged with ___ of hearts monitor to ensure no intrinsic 
arrhythmia.   

#HTN- Pt had currently been on atenolol and amlodipine with 
baseline BPs in the 130s to 160s, but amlodipine recently 
stopped by patient due to leg swelling. Presented to ED in the 
180s and came down to the 150s without. We continued home 
atenolol 50 mg BID.

#Asthma- not currently taking any outpatient meds. Pt was found 
to have wheezes on exam and given albuterol nebs q 6 hrs prn and 
was discharged on albuterol inhaler

#Transitional Issues
-Pt will follow up with PCP, ___ will follow up 
results ___ of hearts monitor

-Pt may benefit from social support, therapy, or psych resources 
given stressors.  She states she wants to seek a counselor and 
that she has resources through her PCP. She politely declined 
our help in seeking one.

-As stated earlier, patient was wheezy on exam. Stated she has 
asthma but did not have medications at home. Will be discharged 
with an albuterol inhaler and told to follow up on this issue 
with PCP.
