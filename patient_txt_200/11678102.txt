1.  No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.   
2.  Status post endovascular repair of infrarenal aortic 
aneurysm without 
evidence of endoleak. Minimal increase in size of aneurysm sac 
is noted since ___.   
3.  Bilateral upper lobe nodularity with retained secretions in 
the lower lobe airways could reflect aspiration or other 
inflammatory/infectious process.

urinalysis. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The pt was admitted to the hospital for hypotension and 
bradycardia.  On the first hospital day a CTA was done that 
showed no pulmonary emboism and serial troponins were flat.  The 
pt improved dramatically with IV fluids and witholding his 
antihypertensives.  He was monitored on telemetry for 24 hours 
that showed continued bradycardia and stable blood pressures.

On the second hospital day he was still at baseline and had not 
had any evidence of returning hypertension.  He and his wife 
stated that he did not want a pacemaker and there was no 
evidence that the bradycardia was causing his symptoms.  It was 
thought that his hypotension was related to decreased PO intake 
and hypertensive medications.  After the observation period it 
was thought that he was safe to return home.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you in the hospital. You were 
admitted with low blood pressures and were watched in the ICU. 
Your blood pressures returned to normal. We think that your 
blood pressures were probably low from using your 
hydrochlorothiazide while not taking in enough by mouth. Your 
other blood pressures medications may have contributed as well. 
You appeared dehydrated and were given IV fluids with 
improvement in your kidney function.

We stopped your blood pressure medications since these were 
likely contributing to your low blood pressure. You should 
continue to remain off these medications for the time being.
