History of Present Illness:
The pt is a ___ yo F with RRMS (pt of Dr. ___ who presents 
with chronic progressive fatigue, weakness and possible UTI.

Pt was last seen in clinic with Dr. ___ week. At that 
time she was noted to have had a worsening of her MS symptoms, 
specifically her weakness in the R lower extremity. She had 
missed two Tysabri doses over the preceding months because of 
hospitalization including an admission with UTI/pyelonephritis 
and a fifth metarsal fracture in the right foot. Dr. ___ debated treating these symptoms with a course high 
dose steroids but opted to give her the scheduled Tysabri 
infusion. 

Since her appointment last week, the patient has noticed 
progression of all her symptoms including fatigue, gait, 
weakness, (generalized as well as more specifically in the RLE 
and RUE as well). She is unable to walk unassisted at this point 
given the weakness and an overall sense of imbalance. 

She has a chronic headache which is nothing new. She has nausea 
though and is unable to tolerate being in the car because of the 
back and forth movement. 

Of note, she has recently completed two Abx courses for 
recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis and has felt the recurrence of 
frequency and
burning and believes she might have a repeat UTI. 

She notes that tysabri infusions have always been well tolerated 
in the past and that she would typically get a "boost" in her 
energy. However this time she did not experience any beneficial 
effects.

MRI C and T spine ___:

EXAM: MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine. 
  
CERVICAL SPINE: 
  
FINDINGS: There is inhomogeneous signal visualized within the 
cervical spinal cord with foci of signal abnormalities at C2-3, 
C4-5 and C7-T1 levels consistent with diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis with multiple sclerosis plaques. No enhancement is 
seen on the post-gadolinium images. Degenerative changes are 
seen in the cervical spine with mild bulging at C4-5 and C5-6. 
No evidence of high-grade spinal stenosis is seen. 
  
IMPRESSION: Foci of signal abnormalities in cervical spinal cord 
indicative of multiple sclerosis plaques. No enhancing lesions 
are seen. 
  
THORACIC SPINE: 
  
TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial 
images of 
thoracic spine were acquired before gadolinium. T1 sagittal and 
axial images were obtained following gadolinium. 
  
FINDINGS: Multiple foci of signal abnormalities are seen within 
the thoracic spinal cord including T5, T7-8, T10 levels 
indicative of diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Following 
gadolinium administration no enhancing lesions are identified in 
the thoracic region. Mild degenerative disc disease is 
identified. 
  
IMPRESSION: Multiple foci of signal abnormalities within the 
thoracic spinal cord indicative of diagnosis of multiple 
sclerosis. No definite enhancing lesions are seen. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
The pt is a ___ year-old W w/ hx of relapsing remitting MS who 
presents with worsening leg weakness, blurred vision, fatigue 
and gait instability. Although her blurred vision is unchanged, 
her gait symptosm appear to have progressed over the past 3 
days. Her exam is remarkable for ___ weakness in UMN 
distribution, hyperreflexia b/l, clonus on L and gait consistent 
with IP and TA dysfunction. Her sx appear to be consistent w/ an 
MS exacerbation. It is unclear what is the actual course of her 
dz and her the neuroanatomical basis of her lesions was also 
unknown at time of admission. She does have L spine dz, and her 
exam is consistent w/ both UMN and LMN disease. 

She was admitted for high dose steroid treatment per protocol 
designed by Dr. ___.  1g of Solumedrol x 3 days, then 500mg x 
3 days, then 250mg x3 days.  She was ruled out for infections 
prior to starting of steroids.  She was started on Protonix 40mg 
BID, ISS and Seroquel 50mg HS for possible psychosis (severe 
agitation, flight of ideas, pressured thoughts, irritability 
noted during previous steroid treatments).
She was also treated with KCL 10mEq TID for replacement of 
potential losses.  Her SSRI was held during this time.  
Ibuprofen 600mg Q8H prn was used for pain control.

With this treatment, by HD3, her ___ weakness improved 
significantly and lateralized with slightly greater weakness on 
the L.  Her gait improved significantly (still w/ mildly wide 
base and trace b/l foot drop), as did UEs strength (full).

MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine, with and without 
gadolinium revealed C2-5, C7-T1 and T5, T7-8, T10 levels of 
plaque lesions without enhancement after gadolinium.  

Her mood remained euthymic until ___ and on ___ did develop 
irritability and labile mood. Patient felt that this could be 
managed with Seroquel 75mg daily for now.  Should she develop 
worsening manic symptoms, the dosage could be increased and her 
outpatient neurologist could be contacted, Dr. ___ at ___, 
as she has had specific regimens for treatment of these symptoms 
in the past.

On day of discharge, her examination was remarkable for intact 
UE strength bilaterally, IP 4 b/l, Hamstrings 4+ b/l, TA 4+ b/l, 
Quads, Gastroctnemius, ___ ___ b/l.  Her gait was improved, but 
remained spastic, with circumduction of RLE.  Her toes were 
upgoing bilaterally.  

She will require a total of 9 days of steroid treatment (see 
above for regimen, day 1 = ___.  She will require continuation 
of PPI BID and ISS for the duration of the treatment, as well as 
Seroquel 75mg QHS, this may be uptightrated.  She may be resumed 
on her home medications, excluding Rebif after completion of her 
 treatment with steroids.  She will require potassium repletion 
to a goal of 4.
