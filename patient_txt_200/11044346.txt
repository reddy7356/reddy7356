History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ year old gentleman who was an unrestrained driver 
in a single vehicle motor vehicle accident early in the morning 
of ___. Per reports the patient was driving on Route ___ under 
the influence of ETOH when he swerved off the road into a 
collection of trees and then back onto the road. There was 
significant damage to the car with the windshield being blown 
out and debris surround the patient. He did not require 
extubation at the scene but was
brought to ___ where he was intubated for airway protection. 
He had an obvious open right fronto-parietal skull fracture 
approximately 2cm in size as well as ___ inches of exposed bone 
with pieces of what appear to be wood infiltrating the open 
portion of the fracture. The patient was paralyzed upon arrival 
of neurosurgery but per reports both at the scene and upon 
arrival in the ER the patient was moving all extremities and 
opening his eyes but was not following commands and his GCS was 
estimated to be 8. He also was noted to have vomited multiple 
times both in the field and in the ER here. He was pan-scanned
per trauma protocol which did not reveal any significant 
injuries to other parts of his body on preliminary reports and 
then was taken emergently to the OR for washout and elevation of 
his open depressed skull fracture.

Pertinent Results:
___ Head CT:
Large right frontoparietal scalp subgaleal hematoma, 
subcutaneous locules of gas and laceration. There is an 
underlying comminuted, displaced and 
depressed fracture of the right frontoparietal bone, extending 
posteriorly to the lambdoid suture. There are hyperattenuating 
foci along the right frontal region, which may represent small 
contusions or foci of diffuse axonal injury (___). No evidence 
of shift of normally midline structures or central herniation at 
this time. 
  
NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is also "contre-coup" 
subarachnoid 
hemorrhage in the contralateral sylvian fissure, as well as 
likely small 
contusion or focus ___ or less likely, subdural hemorrhage, 
in the 
periphery of the left frontal operculum, without significant 
mass effect. 

___ CT Torso:
Left lung base consolidation likely aspiration. No other injury 
to the chest, pelvis, or abdmomen noted.

___ CT Cspine:
1. No evidence of acute cervical spine fracture or alignment 
abnormality. 
2. NG tube appears coiled in the oral cavity and the upper 
thoracic esophagus  (as on the concurrent CECT torso); correlate 
clinically. 
  
___ CT head
1. Small hyperattenuating foci in the right frontal l.obe and 
"contre-coup" 
lesion in the left frontal operculum, representing contusion or 
___, are 
unchanged. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left Sylvian 
fissure is also stable. 
2. No mass effect or new hemorrhage identified. 
3. Stable large right frontoparietal subgaleal hematoma, status 
post operative repair of depressed skull fracture and scalp 
laceration.  

___ CXR
Left lower lobe consolidation has largely cleared since ___ consistent with resolved aspiration or pulmonary contusion. 
Lungs are fully expanded and clear. Normal cardiomediastinal and 
hilar silhouettes and pleural surfaces. 

___ C-spine flexion and extension imaging
 No radiographic evidence for dynamic instability

___ Chest x-ray
Right PIC C line ends in the right atrium. Suggest pulling back 
4 
cm. Otherwise, normal radiographic examination of the chest. 
  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was intubated in the ED for airway protection. He did 
have
multiple episodes of vomiting per report from EMT en route to 
the
hospital.  He had a ab/pelvis/chest CT per trauma protocol which 
did not reveal any significant abdominal injuries on preliminary 
reports but his left lung base had a
consolidation. He was taken directly to the OR from the ER for 
elevation of the skull fracture and washout of the wound. In the 
OR, wood was seen in the fracture cavity but no dural 
penetration. Pieces of the wood was sent for culture. He was 
then admitted to the neuro ICU for close monitoring. He was 
started on Vanc/Flagyl/Cetrax. MRSA screen is pending. Plastic 
surgery came and sutured his lip. Infectious disease was 
consulted and they recommended the Tdap vaccine. He remained 
intubated for his repeat Head CT. This showed post-op chnages 
and no new hemorrhage. He was extubated. On ___ he was 
transfered to the floor. His cervical spine was cleared by the 
ICU after Ct c-spine showed no fracture. 

His diet was advanced. He was voiding well. 

On ___ he reported neck pain. Flexion and extension X-rays 
showed no sign of instability. He was seen by ___ and OT. His 
surgical dressing was removed. Wound nurses did not feel that 
there was any special dressing needed. Plastic surgery requested 
bactitracin to facial lacerations as needed. ___ felt that he 
could beneift from home ___.

MRSA and blood culures were negative as of ___ and a PICC 
line was requested and placed. ID made new recommendations for 
cefepime 2Q12, Flagyl 500 TID x 10d. We got names from his PCP 
for ___ and Neurosurgery follow up. The Plastic surgeons do 
not take his insurance. The cost for suture removal was  relayed 
to the parents. They should go to their pediatrician for the 
sutures if they choose.
