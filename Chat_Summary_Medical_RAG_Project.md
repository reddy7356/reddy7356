## üè• Medical Case Report Details

### **Source File:**
- **Path:** `/Users/saiofocalallc/clinical insight bot/Case Trial.txt`
- **Content:** 74-year-old woman with breast cancer, sacroiliac metastases
- **Procedures:** Radiofrequency ablation, PBSS fixation attempt
- **Complications:** Respiratory distress, ARDS, chemical pneumonitis
- **Outcome:** Discharged to hospice, passed 6 months later

### **Sample Queries Tested:**
- "What is the patient's age?"
- "What is the patient's diagnosis?"
- "What treatment was planned?"
- "What complications occurred?"
- "What medications were used during anesthesia?"
- "What was the outcome for this patient?"

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### **Haystack 2.x Components:**
- Custom `MedicalRetriever` with medical terminology mapping
- Custom `MedicalGenerator` for medical-specific answers
- Pipeline architecture for RAG workflow
- Document chunking and metadata management

### **File Handling:**
- Automatic encoding detection and handling
- Paragraph-based document chunking
- Configuration file management
- Error handling and validation

### **Multi-Case Architecture:**
- Configuration-driven case report loading
- Cross-case document retrieval
- Source tracking and identification
- Scalable pipeline design

## üìä System Capabilities

### **Single Case Analysis:**
```bash
python app.py                    # Test single case system
python chatbot.py               # Interactive chat
python query_medical_case.py "What is the patient's age?"
```

### **Multi-Case Analysis:**
```bash
python add_case_report.py       # Add new case reports
python multi_case_rag.py        # Test multi-case system
python query_multiple_cases.py "What treatments were used across cases?"
```

### **Case Management:**
- Add new case reports via helper script
- Automatic file copying and organization
- Configuration file management
- Case report listing and verification

## üéØ Key Achievements

1. **Successfully transformed** the entire RAG system from historical content to medical analysis
2. **Implemented medical-specific** retrieval and generation components
3. **Created multi-case capability** for comprehensive medical analysis
4. **Built user-friendly interfaces** for different use cases
5. **Established robust file handling** with encoding support
6. **Provided comprehensive documentation** and guides

## üîß Technical Solutions

### **Encoding Issues:**
- Implemented multi-encoding support
- Automatic fallback to different encodings
- Robust error handling for file loading

### **Medical Terminology:**
- Created specialized medical term mapping
- Enhanced scoring for medical queries
- Medical-specific answer generation

### **Multi-Case Management:**
- Configuration file system
- Automatic file organization
- Helper scripts for easy management

## üìà System Performance

### **Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Successfully loads medical case reports
- ‚úÖ Handles different file encodings
- ‚úÖ Provides accurate medical answers
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple case reports
- ‚úÖ Cross-case analysis working

### **Query Examples:**
- Patient demographics: "74-year-old woman"
