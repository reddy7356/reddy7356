A 70-year-old female patient (height: 153 cm; weight: 57 kg), classified as ASA III, was scheduled for surgical excision of a 2.5 cm ? 2 cm midline frontal BCC (Figure 1). Her medical history included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral valve prolapse, and transient ischemic attack.On the day of surgery, routine monitoring was applied, and the patient was positioned supine. Intravenous midazolam (2 mg) was administered for anxiolysis. Bilateral nerve blocks were then performed using anatomical landmarks: supraorbital (1 mL each side), supratrochlear (0.5 mL each side), and zygomaticotemporal nerves (2 mL each side), with a total of 7 mL 0.5% bupivacaine administered (Figure 1).Following confirmation of adequate sensory blockade, 50 mcg IV fentanyl was given, and sedation was maintained with a propofol infusion at 1 mg/kg/h. The procedure involved wide local excision, subcutaneous tissue undermining, and primary closure (Figure 2). The surgery lasted approximately 40 minutes, and intraoperative hemodynamic parameters remained stable.Postoperatively, 1 g of paracetamol was administered as part of multimodal analgesia. The patient was transferred to the PACU (postanesthesia care unit) without complications. Pain was well controlled with a visual analog score (VAS) of 0 during the initial 2 hours in PACU. During the 48-hour postoperative period, the patient remained pain-free and required no additional analgesics.
