A 68-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient had a previous myocardial infarction two years ago and was on multiple medications including metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Initial evaluation revealed elevated troponin levels and ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram consistent with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The patient was immediately taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where coronary angiography revealed a 95% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed with placement of a drug-eluting stent. The procedure was technically successful with restoration of TIMI 3 flow. The patient received dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as intravenous heparin during the procedure.

Post-procedure, the patient was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit for monitoring. He developed mild contrast-induced nephropathy with a transient rise in creatinine from 1.2 to 1.8 mg/dL, which resolved with intravenous hydration. The patient also experienced a brief episode of atrial fibrillation that was successfully managed with amiodarone and converted to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's hospital course was otherwise uncomplicated. He was discharged on day 4 with instructions for cardiac rehabilitation and follow-up with his cardiologist. At three-month follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms and had no further cardiac events. Echocardiography showed preserved left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 55%.
