Vallecular rupture is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that could have deleterious outcome due to upper airway and jugular venous compression. Postintubation airway rupture (PiAR) is a rare condition being tracheal rupture associated with emergent endotracheal intubation (EEI) the most common type with a prevalence less than 0.37% in general population. Vallecular rupture is very uncommon. Its prevalence associated with subcutaneous emphysema preceded by EEI is unknown. PiAR is characterised by inadvertent airflow into the surrounding soft tissue, which may extend to the head, neck, intra/extra thoracic, abdomen and extremities. Subcutaneous emphysema is a predominant clinical feature.An 84-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation was transferred from an outside facility with a history of failed tracheal intubation after an episode of syncope preceded by a brief episode of severe shortness of breath. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was unresponsive and ventilated through laryngeal mask. Physical examination depicted palpable cutaneous crepitus compatible with extensive subcutaneous emphysema extending from bilateral upper thighs to the head. This was associated with non-pitting oedema. Emphysema was confirmed with portable chest X-ray film. She was tachypnoeic with oxygen saturation of 96%. Otorhinolaryngology was consulted for suspected upper airway rupture and airway stabilization. The patient was taken to the operating room and direct laryngoscopy revealed a laceration on the left vallecula. Bronchoscopy was unremarkable; a tracheotomy was done without complications. Subcutaneous emphysema resolved completely 1â€‰week after the tracheostomy, but the patient died from complications related to her underlying comorbidities.
